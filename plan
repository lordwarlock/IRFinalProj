Information Retrieval Final Project
player based search :	rule based
		 	wiki
			height, age, position, birth place, intro

club based search :	rule based
		 	wiki
			founded year, ground, full name, nick name, intro

match based search :	rule based, Information Extraction
		 	sky sports match reports, match data set
			Title, text
			result, goals, red card, players, subs, referee,
			<player performance(score)>, <home>, <away>
			player highlights

prediction :	Machine Learning (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
		Better than 50%
		w-d-l
		features : home, away, history features,
			   current season features
		0-10
		player performance
		features : home, away, history, current season

4 weeks plan:
week 1, <Premier League players>
	build data set for player based search(Junchao)
	scheme design for player based search(Junchao)

	<Premier League clubs>
	build data set for club based search(Kemi)
	scheme design for club based search(Kemi)

	<sky sports>
	web crawler, get data from sky sports(Zhihao Meiyue)
	Thursday, progress check
	start implementing query for player based search(Junchao)
