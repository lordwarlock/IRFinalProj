<title>Bale brace sinks Stoke</title>
<content>
A stunning goal from Gareth Bale earned Tottenham an excellent 2-1 win against a spirited Stoke side who will feel aggrieved at a late decision not to award them an equaliser.
The Welsh winger fortuitously gave Spurs the lead in the 19th minute after Peter Crouch's effort was bundled off the line by Ryan Shawcross, only for the ball to deflect of Bale's face and into the net.
If his first effort was lucky though, his second was a piece of pure brilliance. Ricardo Fuller had pulled one back for the Potters after a smart close-range finish from a corner in the 25th minute, but the North Londoners regained their lead just five minutes later.
Aaron Lennon used his pace and trickery to drive forward into the Stoke half and he picked out Bale with a lovely ball to the left side of the area, and he hit a sweet volley into the top corner leaving Thomas Sorensen with no chance.
After the break Tony Pulis' men came out firing and substitute Tuncay Sanli nodded narrowly wide before controversy reigned in the dying minutes.
Jon Walters had a header cleared off the line by Crouch, and although it looked like the ball may have crossed the line, referee Chris Foy ruled no goal.
Stoke almost took the lead inside two minutes after good work by Walters following his arrival from Ipswich in midweek.
He made space down the right and delivered the ball into the area. However Michael Dawson made a crucial interception with Fuller ready to pounce.
Tottenham made the breakthrough in the 19th minute with Bale at the heart of things. The Wales full-back cracked in a shot that was blocked by goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen.
Crouch was first to react but his effort came back off Shawcross. However, to the Stoke skipper's horror, his clearance ricocheted off Bale and into the net.
Stoke drew level in the 25th minute with Tottenham guilty of poor defending. Younes Kaboul directed Matthew Etherington's corner back across the six-yard area and Fuller clipped a shot beyond Heurelho Gomes.
Tottenham regrouped and regained their lead in the 30th minute with a stunning second goal from Bale.
Lennon began the move and got beyond the defence before lofting the ball into the Welshman's path. Bale showed superb technique to crack in a volley from the left that flew over Sorensen and high into the right-hand corner of the net.
Tottenham were spraying the ball about well and Bale released Lennon. The winger however took a touch too many and Stoke were able to clear their lines.
Fuller then carved out an opening for himself with a quick turn on the edge of the area which left him with only Gomes to beat.
The Jamaican, though, failed to get enough power on his shot and the goalkeeper made a comfortable save.
Bale then showed a fine turn of pace in first-half stoppage-time to get to the byline and whip the ball across. But Sorensen twice denied Jermaine Jenas from adding to Spurs' lead.
With Stoke still finding it hard to break the visitors down Pulis introduced Tuncay in the 64th minute for the ineffective Glenn Whelan.
Then Lennon split the home defence to find Wilson Palacios, who drove the ball across the face of the area but Danny Collins scrambled it away.
Tuncay almost pulled Stoke level with a shot from 25 yards that took a huge deflection but Gomes somehow got up and turned it over the bar.
Tuncay was then wasteful, heading wide at the far post from Etherington's corner before Shawcross fired a close-range shot over the bar in a good spell of pressure by Stoke.
Tottenham then hit back with Tom Huddlestone spraying the ball out to Bale. He was on course for a hat-trick but with only Sorensen to beat saw his effort blocked.
