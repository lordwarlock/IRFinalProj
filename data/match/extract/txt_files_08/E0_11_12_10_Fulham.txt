<title>Red-hot Cole fires Hammers</title>
<content>
West Ham boosted their survival hopes with an impressive 3-1 win over London rivals Fulham at Craven Cottage.
Carlton Cole maintained his fine record against Fulham with two opportunistic strikes with Frederic Piquionne netting the other for West Ham to cancel out Aaron Hughes' early opener for the home side.
Hughes gave Fulham the lead after just 11 minutes when he headed home unmarked inside the box to net his first goal for more than six years.
West Ham were gifted their equaliser on 37 minutes when Dickson Etuhu inadvertently gave the ball straight to Cole to slide the ball past Mark Schwarzer.
Piquionne stunned the home side when he volleyed in Scott Parker's cross in first-half stoppage time.
Cole made the game safe 17 minutes from time when he fired low into the net after Fulham failed to deal with a long ball from Danny Gabbidon.
The win eases the pressure on Hammers boss Avram Grant, but for Fulham it stretches their winless run to eight games to leave Mark Hughes under fire.
The Cottagers boss left the field to chants of "Hughes out!" after earlier enduring taunts of "You don't know what you're doing!"
Grant's own pre-match desperation was summed up by Freddie Sears being handed his first Premier League start since March 2009 in one of five changes for the visitors.
The 21-year-old striker, recalled early from a loan spell at Scunthorpe, had scored just one goal in his entire 71-match professional career.
But, playing down the right, he made an immediate impact with a decent cross for the recalled Cole, who was under good pressure.
The fit-again Robert Green palmed behind a Carlos Salcido shot that was going wide and the visitors failed to clear the resulting corner, allowing Simon Davies to cross for the unmarked Hughes to nod home.
Recalled Fulham forward Andrew Johnson tested Green from distance two minutes later and should have doubled the hosts' lead in the 18th minute when he failed to connect properly with Davies' cross from six yards.
Fulham continued to dominate and even began playing keep ball as the half progressed but gifted their toothless opponents an equaliser with eight minutes remaining.
Sears' weak cross was intercepted by Etuhu but the midfielder could only divert the ball straight to Cole, who stretched to angle it beyond the onrushing Mark Schwarzer from six yards.
Cole should have made it 2-1 when he shot straight at the goalkeeper after being put through one on one with a minute remaining.
But Piquionne incredibly put the visitors ahead in stoppage-time when he arrived completely unmarked to volley in Parker's cross.
Matthew Upson picked up the game's first yellow card early in the second half for tripping Clint Dempsey.
But the free-kick came to nought and West Ham should have scored themselves in the 52nd minute but another heavy touch from Cole let him down.
Green beat Andrew Johnson to John Pantsil's cross as the hosts searched for an equaliser but the latter then got himself booked after bringing down Stanislas.
Only a desperate clearance from Brede Hangeland prevented Cole turning in Parker's 64th-minute cross, and Sears sent a shot on the turn wide moments later.
Hangeland then played a defence-splitting pass to Andrew Johnson but Green was off his line in a flash to block the forward's finish.
Junior Stanislas had an effort deflected behind in the 71st minute before another calamity befell Fulham two minutes later.
Hughes tried to cut out a long ball forward but only succeeded in nodding straight to Cole, who fired a superb angled drive across Schwarzer.
Eddie Johnson forced a superb fingertip save from Green trying to pull a goal back and Danny Murphy should have done better than blazing over Duff's cross.
With time running out, Andrew Johnson was unable to get enough power on a shot on the turn.
But Fulham were already beaten and West Ham had the luxury of making a late change when Frank Nouble came on for Piquionne before the chants of "Hughes out!" began.
