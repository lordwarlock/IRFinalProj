<title>Howard gifts Rovers win</title>
<content>
Tim Howard's first-half howler proved to be costly as Blackburn edged Everton 1-0 at Ewood Park. 
Nikola Kalinic reacted fastest when Everton goalkeeper Howard dropped an innocuous-looking cross after 14 minutes, swivelling to strike the ball into the empty net.
Everton have lost five of their last seven curtain-raisers and their lacklustre passing and attacking never looked like troubling a well-marshalled Rovers defence.
Substitute Steven N'Zonzi came close to doubling the home side's advantage late in the second period, but his close-range header sailed over.
Toffees defender Phil Jagielka came closest to earning a point for his side, but his powerful drive from the dge of the penalty area was well-saved by Blackburn keeper Paul Robinson.
Everton went into the match with high expectations as they had a fully fit squad to call on.
Instead they failed to get going and it was only late in the game goalkeeper Robinson was tested.
Blackburn almost scored after two minutes when Morten Gamst Pedersen's clever chip released Martin Olsson but with only goalkeeper Howard to beat he hoisted his shot over the top.
Howard was again called into action four minutes later and dealt comfortably with a header from El-Hadji Diouf following a long ball from Gael Givet.
Blackburn, however, were forced to make a change after nine minutes with N'Zonzi replacing David Dunn, who appeared to have suffered a groin strain.
Sam Allardyce's side then took the lead in the 14th minute following a mistake from Howard.
He raced out his goal to try and clear his lines but instead spilled the ball and Kalinic was on hand to sweep it home.
It was just the boost Blackburn wanted so early in the game but Howard was left distraught.
Blackburn found themselves on the back foot after 29 minutes when Tim Cahill made space in the area only to scuff a shot into goalkeeper Robinson's arms.
Everton were beginning to pick up the pace of the game and Louis Saha got away from Christopher Samba five minutes later. The French striker cut inside only to see his effort blocked.
Then Mikel Arteta's free-kick was deflected before Steven Pienaar tested the goalkeeper, who saved at the second attempt after the ball bobbled up in front of him.
Two minutes later manager David Moyes switched things around by introducing former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford for the ineffective Leon Osman.
Allardyce followed suit in the 60th minute by handing Mame Biram Diouf, on loan from Manchester United, his debut. He replaced Kalinic, who had put in a hard shift.
Mame Biram Diouf was looking lively after coming on and saw his shot cleared by Howard, only to be ruled offside.
Blackburn nearly extended their lead in the 78th minute when N'Zonzi got on the end of a cross from El-Hadji Diouf but headed marginally over the bar.
Everton kept pushing forward and substitute Jack Rodwell made space to get in a header two minutes from time but it went wide of the post. Then Jagielka thumped in a shot in stoppage time but Robinson was equal to it and prevented the visitors from equalising.
