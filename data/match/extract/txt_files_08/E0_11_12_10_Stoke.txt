<title>DJ leaves Stoke in a spin</title>
<content>
DJ Campbell was the hero of the hour for Blackpool on Saturday as his solitary strike saw off Stoke and lifted the Seasiders into the top half of the table.
The striker struck shortly after half-time to hand Ian Holloway's side all three points at the Britannia Stadium.
Stoke had the better of the chances in the opening 45 minutes, with Ricardo Fuller crashing a dipping effort from 25 yards off the crossbar at one stage.
They started the second period sluggishly, though, and were punished when Campbell pounced to prod home from close range following good work by Luke Varney and Charlie Adam.
Both sides had opportunities to add to the scoring thereafter, with Gary Taylor-Fletcher nodding against the bar for the visitors and Matthew Etherington clipping a free-kick off the woodwork for the hosts.
However, there were to be no further goals and Blackpool can now add three points in the Potteries to their remarkable top-flight checklist.
Blackpool have now collected six wins and 22 points from 16 games - a remarkable tally given they were widely tipped for relegation.
Prior to kick-off a montage of the late Sir Stanley Matthews, who served both clubs and England with distinction, was well received by home and away supporters.
Matthews would have been proud of the way Blackpool not only kept the ball but showed resilience when needed.
Blackpool showed what they were about in the 15th minute when David Vaughan clipped a volley narrowly over the top after a cross from Stephen Crainey.
Holloway's side were beginning to settle into the game and Campbell found himself in a good position, however, he found the wrong side of the post with his effort.
Stoke almost took the lead in the 36th minute following a piece of inspiration from Fuller.
The Jamaican got on the end of a pass from Etherington 25 yards out and sent in a superb shot that beat Richard Kingson but came back off the bar.
Back came Blackpool and Adam delivered a delightful ball into the path of Elliot Grandin six yards out.
But the midfielder seemed slow to react and goalkeeper Asmir Begovic got there ahead of him and made the clearance.
Stoke were anxious to make the breakthrough before half-time and twice came close to taking the lead.
Jermaine Pennant, showing no ill-effects after his injury, delivered a cross into the path of Rory Delap but he headed into the arms of the goalkeeper.
Then Delap found the net but his celebration was cut short when the effort was disallowed for Robert Huth's challenge on Kingson.
Stoke made a determined start to the second half and Dean Whitehead found space on the edge of the area but hoisted his shot over the bar.
Two minutes later Blackpool launched a swift counter-attack and Campbell opened the scoring.
Adam and Varney linked up, resulting in a deft finish by Campbell at the back post.
It was the striker's third league goal of the campaign following his arrival from Leicester in August.
Blackpool were growing in confidence at a ground where some of the top sides in the league have found it a struggle in the past.
Adam and Vaughan were pulling the strings in midfield and that meant Fuller and Jones were being deprived of good service.
Fuller did break into the area in the 63rd minute only to scuff his shot wide of the post.
Blackpool then came within a whisker of adding a second goal in the 66th minute.
Taylor-Fletcher came up on the blind side to get on the end of an inswinging free-kick from Adam only for his header to come back off the bar.
Stoke came close to equalising in the 73rd minute when Etherington struck a free-kick firm and true only for it to rattle the woodwork.
Two minutes later Kingson reacted instinctively to push up a goal-bound header from Huth and Crainey cleared off the line as the home side kept up the pressure.
