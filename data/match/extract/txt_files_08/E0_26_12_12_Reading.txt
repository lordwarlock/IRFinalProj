Reading held Swansea to a goalless stalemate at the Madejski Stadium to climb off the bottom of the Premier League table.
The point ended the Royals' seven-match losing run in the league and saw them climb above QPR in the table, although Brian McDermott's side sit six points from safety.
The visitors started the brighter, shrugging off the controversy surrounding Ashley Williams kicking the ball at Robin van Persie in their 1-1 draw to Manchester United last time.
Top-scorer Michu curled a shot just wide from the edge of the area early on before Ki Sung-Yueng blasted a free-kick over from distance.
Michu then had the ball in the net but was adjudged to have fouled Adrian Mariappa in the build-up.
At the other end, Reading finally showed threat but Jimmy Kebe volleyed well wide from the edge of the box following Ian Harte's free-kick.
The ever-threatening Michu volleyed over from six yards out after latching onto a poor chest back by Chris Gunter, while Nathan Dyer blasted well over from outside the box twice as the first half ended in a stalemate.
After the break, Ki shot well over from range before Reading boss McDermott brought on Adam Le Fondre and Hal Robson-Kanu just after the hour-mark.
At the other end, Adam Federici did well to push Dyer's header around the post before the Reading keeper then produced a good save to catch Ki's powerful effort from the edge of the box.
Le Fondre looked lively following his introduction and had the ball in the net from a Harte free-kick but the goal was rightly disallowed and the striker booked for using his hand.
Michu went off injured late on before Le Fondre's goalbound volley was headed off the line by Chico as the game ended all square.
