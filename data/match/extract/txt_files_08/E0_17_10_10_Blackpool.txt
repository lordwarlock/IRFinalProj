Blackpool were introduced to the genuine cruelty of the Premier League as a combination of wasted opportunities and debatable decisions from match officials allowed Manchester City to collect a 3-2 win at Bloomfield Road.  
Hammerings at Arsenal and Chelsea were expected, while a late loss to Blackburn was painful, but for Ian Holloway's 2009/10 Championship play-off winners the loss to City provided the first dose of reality.
Having defeated Liverpool on their last outing, Blackpool were on an undeniable high, however, the defeat to City, who will know title contenders need to grind results such as these, was as harsh as the win at Anfield was memorable.
Following a goalless first half, in which City underwhelmed at a time when Blackpool, who have not won at home in the league this season, could not find a reward for their enthusiastic approach, the match came to life after the interval.
DJ Campbell was guilty of blowing a glorious opportunity when one-on-one with City's England goalkeeper, Joe Hart, and in quick succession Gary Taylor-Fletcher saw a goal disallowed for a highly-debatable offside flag.
That offered Roberto Mancini's money-rich City the opportunity to demonstrate the theory which states that a failure to take chances at the highest level always proves costly as Carlos Tevez scored in the 67th minute with a brilliant flicked finish.
Substitute Marlon Harewood headed past Hart in the 78th minute to raise hopes of a glorious turnaround in the closing minutes, but lady luck was again not smiling on Blackpool as a Tevez shot deflected off Craig Cathcart on its way into the back of the net 60 seconds later.
David Silva stepped off the City bench to add gloss to the scoreline with an excellent solo effort in injury-time to mean that Taylor-Fletcher's goal on the stroke of the final whistle was nothing more than a consolation.
Second-placed City only got going as a team in the second half, but City captain Tevez, who has now scored 28 goals in his last 31 league games, made his intentions clear as early as the fourth minute when he dragged his shot across the face of the area.
Blackpool again found themselves on the back foot two minutes later. Adam Johnson thumped in a shot that Matt Gilks did well to turn over the bar.
The home team responded two minutes later but Campbell dragged his effort wide of the post.
Back came City and Vincent Kompany's powerful header was saved by Gilks in the 19th minute following a cross from James Milner.
Blackpool were not short of confidence after beating Liverpool and Taylor-Fletcher found himself in space 20 yards out only to direct his effort nearer the corner flag than the goal.
Campbell was also wasteful in the 33rd minute sending a free header wide of the post after a cross from Stephen Crainey.
City responded immediately with Nigel de Jong releasing Tevez. He tried to pick out Adebayor, but David Vaughan was alert to the danger and made the clearance.
Adebayor then looked to be held back by Crainey and failed to connect with a header. The ball broke to former Manchester United striker Tevez, but it came off his chest and Gilks made an easy block.
Blackpool, however, should have taken the lead in the 54th minute when Luke Varney scampered away down the wing and chipped the ball into the path of Campbell.
He got an excellent first touch but with only goalkeeper Hart to beat dragged his effort wide of the post.
There was another scare for City shortly afterwards with Taylor-Fletcher finding the net following a through ball from Charlie Adam but he was ruled to be offside.
The Blackpool supporters were furious at the decision as this was a decent spell by Holloway's side.
Hart again came to City's rescue in the 63rd minute, tipping over a 20-yard thunderbolt from Adam after Campbell had laid the ball into his path.
Two minutes later Blackpool came close again, Neal Eardley forcing a good save from Hart.
They were made to pay in the 67th minute with Tevez opening the scoring. He got in front of Craig Cathcart as Silva played the ball in and forced it home.
Milner twice came close to extending City's lead. He saw his chip cleared off the line by Eardley before Gilks turned his effort over the bar.
Blackpool, however, hit back and equalised in the 78th minute with substitute Harewood guiding a header beyond Hart following a free-kick by Adam.
The home side's celebrations last only a minute with Tevez regaining the lead for City. He nicked the ball off Ian Evatt and rifled in a shot that took a deflection off Cathcart.
