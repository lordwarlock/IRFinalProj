<title>Toure too good for Hammers</title>
<content>
Yaya Toure inspired Manchester City to a functional 3-1 victory over hapless West Ham at Upton Park to move level with Premier League leaders Arsenal.
Roberto Mancini's men, missing captain and star striker Carlos Tevez, took the lead midway through the first half when the Ivory Coast international midfielder lashed home a powerful effort after being found by Gareth Barry.
And the former Barcelona man helped make it 2-0 to the visitors 17 minutes from time, although it was unfortunate Hammers keeper Rob Green who was credited with an own goal after Toure's shot hit the post and came back out only to deflect home off the diving shot-stopper.
Substitute Adam Johnson, on for Mario Balotelli who had little impact on the match, added a third nine minutes from time, rounding Green after a delightful slide-rule pass from David Silva.
City then switched off at the back to allow James Tomkins to head home from a late corner via a deflection off Kolo Toure, but Avram Grant's men remain rooted to the foot of the table after their latest reverse.
The visitors should have taken an early lead when Balotelli - involved in a training ground bust-up with team-mate Jerome Boateng earlier this month - missed his kick in the six-yard box from Jo's low cross.
West Ham looked to hit City on the counter-attack, but despite some promising runs from Scott Parker, there were few options offered in the final third and Junior Stanislas fired his 25-yard free-kick high into the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand.
Upton Park nearly sparked into life after 22 minutes when Stanislas cut inside the City box from the left and drilled an angled strike goalwards, which Joe Hart did well to hold.
Yaya Toure ran through the West Ham rearguard, but his flick from just inside the penalty area lacked power.
City went in front after 30 minutes after a quick break when Barry fed the ball back to Yaya Toure just inside the area.
Despite an attempted diving tackle by Jonathan Spector, the midfielder crashed his shot into the top corner.
The visitors went close to a second goal when Pablo Barrera hacked Balotelli's header off the line. The home fans, though, had little to cheer about, with the atmosphere inside Upton Park very flat.
Parker remained industrious and created space for a 20-yard effort, which sailed harmlessly wide. Julien Faubert did well to turn and whip the ball across the City penalty area, and Frederic Piquionne was unfortunate to see his header fly just over.
West Ham needed some inspiration for the second half, but there was little forthcoming - much to the frustration of the home support.
Victor Obinna drilled the ball in towards the near post from the right, but Hart got there just ahead of Piquionne.
Yaya Toure tried his luck from long distance with a fierce effort, but Green showed strong hands to pluck the ball out of the air.
There were more than a few hefty challenges being put in by both sides, as referee Phil Dowd did his best to let the game flow.
However, as the hour mark approached, Balotelli had pushed his protests too far and was cautioned.
Mancini withdrew Balotelli immediately, sending on England international Johnson, possibly to avoid the temperamental Italian getting himself sent off.
It just about summed up West Ham's afternoon when Obinna cut the ball back from the byline, and Piquionne stepped over - only for Barrera to blast his shot high into the Bobby Moore Stand.
This was a good spell for West Ham now, as for the first time in the match, City came under some sustained pressure.
There were penalty appeals for handball against Yaya Toure as a corner came in, but with so many players jumping as the ball ricocheted onto his arm, it would have been somewhat harsh.
After 73 minutes, Yaya Toure picked up the ball on the left, ghosted past marker Tomkins and darted goalwards. His shot hit the near post, bounced off the unfortunate Green's back and into the net for an own goal.
Not surprisingly, all the spirit was drained from the hosts, who continued to defend deep.
