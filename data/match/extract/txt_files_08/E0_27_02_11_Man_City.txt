<title>Duff dents City title hopes</title>
<content>
Damien Duff hit a second-half equaliser as Fulham deservedly drew at Eastlands to dent Manchester City's title hopes.
It was former City boss Mark Hughes' first visit back to his old club and his new team created a number of half chances, with Clint Dempsey and Danny Murphy having efforts at goal.
But City took the lead on 26 minutes after Mario Balotelli played a one-two with Carlos Tevez before unleashing a great strike from 22 yards into the bottom right corner.
Fulham, though, were not to be denied and Duff slotted home an Andrew Johnson cross from close range soon after the re-start to earn a share of the points.
The result was sweet revenge for Hughes for his dismissal as City manager 14 months ago, with the draw leaving the Blues 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester United, having played a game more.
And ill-feeling between Blues' bosses past and present erupted with an angry exchange at the final whistle, when Roberto Mancini did not appear to look at his predecessor at the post-match handshake, leading to Hughes pulling his hand away in disgust.
But Mancini has more to worry about as - if Tottenham and Chelsea win their games in hand - City will find themselves outside the top four.
And, having complained so often about the huge number of fixtures his team are having to play, Mancini must be concerned about how meekly they faded once the Cottagers had levelled Balotelli's ninth goal of the season.
Having let a number of squad men leave on loan, Mancini now finds injury robbing him of others and far better will be required on Wednesday if City are to dispose of Aston Villa to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.
Fulham headed north boasting a proud record of just one defeat in their last seven league encounters at City.
The most famous, a 3-2 win three seasons ago after the Blues had taken a two-goal lead, saved them from the drop.
These days, City are a far stronger outfit, sitting third in the table and still in with a shout in both the FA Cup and the Europa League.
Yet, with David Silva missing due to an ankle problem and City in the middle of what could turn into 15 matches in seven weeks, the hosts were a lacklustre during the opening stages.
Balotelli went close on a couple of occasions but so did Fulham, whose skipper, Murphy, watched his rising drive fly over midway through the half.
With the atmosphere flat as well, City needed something to raise them.
For once, Tevez, sporting a tight perm, was outdone, both in the fashion stakes and who should score.
Balotelli's 'Mr T-style' dyed blonde hair was fairly distinctive. His goal was better.
Exchanging a couple of short passes with Tevez, the Italy striker was given too much room by Murphy and promptly despatched an excellent shot past Mark Schwarzer.
Had Aleksandar Kolarov showed even a small amount of awareness when he streaked into the box minutes later, City would have had a second.
Instead, the Serbian ignored a posse of expectant team-mates, smashing a shot into the side-netting from an impossible angle.
Fulham kept battling, although there was rather too much aggression from Clint Dempsey, who after engaging in bad-tempered exchanges with Gareth Barry, Yaya Toure and Pablo Zabaleta, was summoned by referee Peter Walton to receive a lecture from Murphy.
But Dempsey's attitude belied a fierce Fulham determination. And within three minutes of the restart they were level.
The execution was simplicity itself. Brede Hangeland sent Johnson flying down the right wing and the former Everton star galloped on a few paces before drilling a cross low into the area, which Duff arrived with perfect timing to tuck home from close range.
As City's response was limited to a Balotelli mis-kick after Zabaleta had taken advantage of Hangeland's slip to pull a cross back to the near post and holes were appearing with alarming regularity in the hosts' midfield, Edin Dzeko was sacrificed as Mancini abandoned his three-man attack.
The extra solidity Patrick Vieira brought to midfield nearly paid dividends too as Balotelli lifted a pass over the Fulham defence to release Tevez but Schwarzer got his angles right though, pushing the South American's effort just wide.
The veteran Australian needed every inch of his massive frame to touch a dipping Kolarov effort over as City began to build up some momentum, although as it turned out, Fulham looked more plausible winners in the latter stages.
Dempsey and Dembele both went close as Duff terrorised the City defence from his right flank station.
