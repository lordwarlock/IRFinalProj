<title>Osman rescues Everton</title>
<content>
Leon Osman snatched a point for Everton at Goodison Park to cancel out Grant Holt's first-half opener.
The midfielder stuck out a foot to guide substitute Royston Drenthe's shot past Norwich's John Ruddy, who was playing against his former club, with less than 10 minutes left on the clock.
Earlier, City had taken the lead against the run of play when Holt expertly dragged the ball back before firing home an effort beyond Tim Howard and in off the far post.
Up until then, Everton had dominated the match but failed to make chance after chance count, with Osman seeing his goal-bound first-half curler cleared off the line by the impressive Russell Martin.
The Canaries may feel aggrieved not to have picked up all three points on their travels but with the Toffees having the lion's share of possession, Paul Lambert's men may not be so disheartened to take a point away from Merseyside.
It did look like Everton's run of poor luck in front of goal was to continue after they again had numerous chances which they failed to convert.
However, the introduction of on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Drenthe for the last 20 minutes proved pivotal and his positive play was just the performance the Toffees needed.
But before then it was the Canaries captain Holt who was looking likely to grab the headlines when he drilled in his 28th minute goal, marking his sixth in eight games.
Everton manager David Moyes must only dream of having such a player in form because prior to the game at Goodison, just West Brom and Wigan had scored fewer.
One of the main culprits is Tim Cahill who uncharacteristically has failed to find the net in 363 days for the Toffees.
A tally of just 16 goals in 15 matches has undoubtedly contributed to a poor home record which has now brought only eight points from as many fixtures at home for Moyes' men.
That poor record so very nearly continued too as early on Cahill's perfect lay-off from Leighton Baines' cross presented Marouane Fellaini with an opportunity from close range but he slid his shot into the body of Ruddy.
Osman's goalbound shot deflected off Marc Tierney and was then headed behind by Martin. From the resulting corner, Osman saw his set-piece only just flicked behind by Ruddy who did well under the pressure of Fellaini.
Despite the dominance, it was no surprise to Everton fans as they went behind with which was Norwich's first shot of the game.
It came as Phil Jagielka's header went straight up in the air, Steve Morison clipped the ball back into the path of Holt who did well to hold off John Heitinga on the edge of the six-yard box before turning the Dutchman and scoring off the inside of the far post.
Striker Louis Saha endured a frustrating afternoon after he went close twice with a deflected shot clawed out by Ruddy almost under his own crossbar and a low angled drive which sailed just wide.
The hosts had a lucky escape when Phil Neville's slip on the edge of the penalty area put Wes Hoolahan in but no-one was able to take advantage of Andrew Surman's knockdown.
Everton started the second-half on the back foot but created the first chance in the 54th minute when Ruddy saved Osman's shot.
Holt was continuing to pose a towering threat at the other end with 'keeper Howard breathing a sigh of relief as the 30-year-old's looping header dropped wide of the post.
Cahill was replaced by Denis Stracqualursi on the hour and the Argentinian's first touch set up Saha for a shot which Ruddy parried to safety.
Then, with the goalkeeper off his line, the Frenchman had another effort blocked by Martin.
Stracqualursi's introduction brought a more physical presence to the forward line but it was appearance of Drenthe, who has missed the last three matches with injury, which added the all-important injection of pace and unpredictability.
It was he who brought them a change in fortune as when he cut in from the right in the 81st minute to unleash a shot Osman got the slightest of touches to divert the ball inside the near post.
A fierce, swerving shot from Drenthe then caused all kinds of problems for Ruddy who was relieved to get something on the ball to somehow turn it behind, before youngster Conor McAleny, on only his second senior appearance, snatched at his chance to win the match for Everton.
