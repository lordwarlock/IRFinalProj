<title>Reina gaffe ruins Roy's day</title>
<content>
Jose Reina's comical gaffe gifted Arsenal a 1-1 draw at Liverpool after the hosts had battled manfully to recover from Joe Cole's first-half sending-off.
Liverpool's new signing Cole was shown the red card just before half-time for a lunge on Laurent Koscielny, but David Ngog's thumping drive appeared set to give Roy Hodgson three points in his first Premier League game in charge.
However, in the final minute, Reds keeper Reina first made a mess of a cross into the box and then fumbled the ball over his own line after it had bounced back off the post.
Chances were scarce during a stilted first half, with Reina beating away Thomas Vermaelen's free-kick and Milan Jovanovic wastefully lashing a volley off target.
The game erupted in the minutes before and after half-time as Ngog saw his header cleared off the line by Gael Clichy after Glen Johnson's drive had been tipped over by Manuel Almunia.
And, in first-half stoppage-time, Cole was dismissed by referee Martin Atkinson for a rash challenge on Arsenal debutant Koscielny by the touchline.
Rather than let their heads drop at going down to 10 men, Liverpool burst out of the blocks after the interval and grabbed the lead on 47 minutes when Ngog blasted a shot into the top corner after being slipped in by Javier Mascherano.
Arsenal struggled to make the most of their numerical advantage and it appeared their pursuit of an equaliser would end in failure after Tomas Rosicky's curler was tipped over by Reina.
But, in the final minute, Reina failed to deal with a cross into the penalty area and, after the ball clattered off Marouane Chamakh and the post, the Liverpool keeper spilled it over his own line.
Steven Gerrard tested Almunia with a late free-kick before Koscielny emulated Cole by being sent off on his Premier League bow for his new club after picking up a harsh second yellow card for handball.
The equaliser denied Liverpool what would have been only their fourth victory over the Gunners in their last 19 league meetings.
It remains to be seen how much the new wave of optimism which has swept into the club since Hodgson was appointed as manager has been punctured.
One of the reasons for the upbeat mood had been Cole's arrival but while the midfielder's first league start was one to forget, Hodgson did coax a solid showing from wantaway Javier Mascherano.
Fernando Torres was left in reserve, and later entered to a huge ovation after pledging his future to the club and recovering from a groin injury, but Arsenal missed two of their bigger stars more.
Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie were both said to be lacking match-fitness and, while the former was absent altogether, the Dutchman made only a late appearance.
Vermaelen tested Reina early on with a fierce free-kick but aside from that, the first half was almost devoid of action until exploding into life in the closing moments.
Gael Clichy had Arsenal's first serious chance from open play when he broke clear down the left after 30 minutes and fired a shot narrowly over from outside the box.
Liverpool thought an opportunity was opening up soon after when Almunia failed to claim a corner but referee Martin Atkinson spotted a foul by Daniel Agger on Vermaelen.
The action on the field was tight with neither side giving much away but Arsenal were almost caught when Jovanovic raced onto a long ball.
With Cole walking back from an offside position, the Arsenal defence let the ball bounce and the Serbia international darted into the box, only to blast wide.
The game suddenly came alive in the closing minute of the first half.
First Johnson had a shot tipped over by Almunia and Ngog then had a header cleared off the line from the resulting corner.
The complexion of the game then changed completely in injury-time as Cole was sent off for his lunge at Koscielny.
Koscielny returned to the dressing room on a stretcher at the interval but ran out to start the second period as normal.
Liverpool seemed determined not to let their numerical disadvantage bother them and made a blistering start to the second half.
They claimed the lead within two minutes of the restart as Mascherano threaded a ball into the box for Ngog and the Frenchman finished unerringly home at the near post.
Not content with that, the Reds pushed forward again and Martin Skrtel headed wide from a dangerous Gerrard free-kick.
Ngog had an even better chance when he leapt to reach another Gerrard set-piece but could not direct his header on target.
Kuyt created another fine chance after good work on the right but no-one could turn in his ball across goal.
Liverpool were reduced to nine men when Agger left the field for treatment after all three substitutes had been used before the Dane was pressed back into action.
Arsenal stepped up the tempo and Rosicky showed great control with a slaloming run into the area before seeing his shot touched over by Reina.
Maxi Rodriguez then cleared after a desperate goalmouth scramble.
The pressure eventually told in the last minute as Reina failed to grasp the ball after Chamakh hit the post from Rosicky's cross.
Gerrard almost snatched victory as the game went into five minutes of injury-time but Almunia kept out his free-kick.
