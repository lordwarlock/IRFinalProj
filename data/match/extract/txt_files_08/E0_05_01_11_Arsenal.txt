<title>Dour City keep out Gunners</title>
<content>
A rearguard action from Manchester City saw them claim a 0-0 draw with Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.
Roberto Mancini's side rarely looked like they ever wanted more than the point they got, and the Italian and his troops will be happy with their display - which saw them show very little attacking intent.
Arsene Wenger saw his side dominate the opening period with Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas hitting the post.
Van Persie also forced Joe Hart into a wonderful finger-tip save in the second half, but as the match went on a goal for either side became less and less likely.
To compound in the end what was a pretty dismal affair, both sides were reduced to 10 men when Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna were shown red for coming together off the ball.
The point means City stay in second, now two points adrift of leaders Manchester United, while Arsenal, who have a game in hand on the Eastlands outfit, are a further two points back.
Arsenal almost snatched an early lead when Samir Nasri played Jack Wilshere into the left side of the penalty area - but his cut-back was just too far ahead of Van Persie, with Theo Walcott's cross from the goalline then hacked clear.
City - expected to shortly complete the 27million signing of striker Edin Dzeko from Wolfsburg - broke quickly down the right and James Milner drilled a low shot across the area.
Van Persie again went within inches of putting Arsenal ahead when, after nine minutes, the Dutchman created space for a shot from the edge of the City box - and promptly drilled the ball against the base of Hart's right-hand post.
After such a frantic start, it was no surprise to see the tempo of the match drop.
Gareth Barry was cautioned after 21 minutes when he clattered into Arsenal defender Sagna as the right-back looked to break clear.
At the other end, a deep free-kick found its way through to Carlos Tevez at the back post, but Alex Song was able to divert the loose ball behind.
After 27 minutes, Arsenal again hit the woodwork after a quick break through Nasri and Fabregas down the left, with the Arsenal skipper cutting back inside to wrongfoot Heart only for his shot to bounce off the base of the same post as Van Persie's did.
From the rebound, Walcott smashed an angled drive against the other upright, but the offside flag was already raised.
There was a warning for Arsenal when City broke quickly down the right and Tevez drilled the ball just over from 20 yards.
Arsenal were calling for a penalty when Walcott's cross hit Vincent Kompany's trailing arm, but the referee instead gave a only a corner.
The Gunners continued to press as half-time approached, yet were thwarted by some brave last-gasp defending Arsenal soon were back on the offensive following the restart.
Walcott was almost released, but Wilshere's pass ran through to Hart.
On the hour, City's England number one made a fantastic save to send a goal bound 25-yard drive from Van Persie over the crossbar.
Mancini then made a change, replacing the ineffective Jo with England winger Adam Johnson and the visitors looked much more balanced.
As the match entered the final 22 minutes, Walcott was replaced by Arshavin.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger then sent on Nicklas Bendtner, for Wilshere, with 10 minutes left, looking to give Arsenal more presence in attack.
Both teams finished the match with 10 men after full-backs Zabaleta and Sagna were shown straight red cards after pushing their heads together.
