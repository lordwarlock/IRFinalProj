<title>Late goals lift Magpies</title>
<content>
Late goals from Joey Barton and Andy Carroll ensured Alan Pardew's first game in charge of Newcastle United ended on a winning note courtesy of a 3-1 success over Liverpool.
Pardew did not have long to wait to see his first goal at the helm when Carroll nodded down Barton's free-kick and Kevin Nolan converted from close range.
The Reds were much-improved after half-time and levelled matters when Dirk Kuyt capitalised on a mistake by Sol Campbell by slotting the ball past Tim Krul with the aid of a deflection off Steven Taylor.
Krul then saved Fernando Torres's close-range effort after he rolled Jose Enrique while at the other end Nile Ranger fired his shot wide after Martin Skrtel fluffed his clearance.
Newcastle restored their advantage in the 80th minute when Carroll's flick-on caused mayhem in Liverpool's penalty area and Barton was first to the loose ball to slot home from close range.
Carroll added the icing on the cake in injury-time when he was afforded time and space from distance and he duly obliged with a left-footed shot that fizzed home from all of 25 yards out.
The opening goal may have been fashioned on Merseyside, but it did not go to the men in red as two Scousers combined to open the door.
Barton's free-kick was floated perfectly to the far post for Carroll to win a muscular challenge with Sotirios Kyrgiakos and head down for Nolan to fire home his eighth of the season from close range.
The sense of unity fostered by Hughton during his tenure was there for all to see as Nolan was mobbed by his team-mates with the Toon Army celebrating.
Krul had earlier had to palm away a Kyrgiakos snapshot after referee Lee Mason, whose display was at times mystifying, awarded the visitors a soft free-kick for Jose Enrique's challenge on Glen Johnson.
But in an open encounter, both keepers had to remain alert throughout with Liverpool moving the ball well in an attempt to create space for the returning Torres, while Newcastle relied largely upon the physical presence of Carroll and strike partner Shola Ameobi.
The pair combined to great effect on the half hour when Carroll blasted in a low drive from Ameobi's lay-off which forced Jose Reina into a smart save, and the latter saw a 36th-minute effort fly just wide after it clipped Skrtel's heels with the keeper already committed.
In the meantime, Enrique had been in the right place at the right time to keep out Raul Meireles' shot after it had been deflected towards goal by David Ngog, and Kyrgiakos headed a Meireles corner across the face of goal in first half injury time with Liverpool making a big push.
That trend continued after the restart and the visitors were level within five minutes, thanks in part to a slice of good fortune.
Kuyt did well to trick his way past Campbell, but his shot was deflected past Krul by the unwitting Taylor and crept inside the far post.
Liverpool flexed their muscles and could have taken the lead twice within seconds as Torres first headed straight at Krul and then failed to beat him one-on-one after getting in behind a ragged home defence.
However, the Magpies responded and went close themselves when Barton crossed from the left for Carroll to dive in and head over as the ball dropped just over Skrtel's head.
Substitute Ranger, on for the injured Ameobi, might have announced his arrival in style when he ran on to Carroll's 64th-minute knockdown and eased Skrtel off the ball, but his shot from a tight angle flew wide of the far post.
But they took the lead once again with 10 minutes remaining when Carroll and Ranger both helped on Krul's clearance and Barton stole in to snatch all three points.
