<title>Luis Suarez rescued a point for Liverpool in a 1-1 draw with Newcastle at Anfield</title>
<content>
Liverpool were unable to celebrate Steven Gerrard's 600th game for the club with a victory as they were held 1-1 by Newcastle at Anfield.
The Reds had to battle back from a goal down to even secure a share of the spoils and failed to make the most of Fabricio Coloccini's late red card as Newcastle secured a point from a solid defensive display.
Chances were few and far between in the opening exchanges, although Newcastle were troubled by the pace of Raheem Sterling on a couple of occasions before his final ball proved a let-down.
Neither keeper had a serious early save to make, with Luis Suarez's 20-yard free-kick just over the angle of post and crossbar the closest Liverpool came.
Suso's tricky run five minutes before half-time produced another half-chance that was deflected wide but it was Newcastle, on a rare trip towards the Kop, who broke the deadlock with a goal of true quality in the 43rd minute.
Hatem Ben Arfa turned Jose Enrique inside out down the right flank and dinked a ball over to the far post where Yohan Cabaye controlled and volleyed past Brad Jones from a narrow angle.
Tim Krul was finally called into action in the 58th minute when Suarez made room for himself on the edge of the box and fired goalwards, but the Dutch keeper went full-length to push his effort around the post.
Nuri Sahin had an effort deflected just wide but, just as Anfield's frustration levels reached danger point, Liverpool pulled level on 67 with another goal worthy of England's top division.
Enrique's long pass looked more hopeful than anything, but Suarez took the ball on his chest, held off Coloccini and nipped around Krul before tapping into an empty net.
The Uruguayan almost helped Liverpool into the lead seconds later when he tricked his way into the box and set up Jonjo Shelvey, but the sub could not get a meaningful shot away and Krul gratefully clutched the ball to his chest.
Steven Taylor rescued Newcastle with a brave block from Sterling while Ben Arfa's greed cost them at the other end when his shot was saved by Jones after he failed to spot Sammy Ameobi galloping clear.
Coloccini was dismissed seven minutes from time for an ugly lunge on Suarez - he was lucky not to be caught flush on the knee - but Shelvey wasted a free header and Suarez's deflected free-kick bounced off the top of the bar with just about the final kick to leave Liverpool stuck on just one home win this season.
Brendan Rodgers, at least, can draw consolation for preserving Liverpool's impressive unbeaten home record against the Magpies which is extended to 18 league matches - 15 of which were wins.
His counterpart Alan Pardew marched onto the field at full-time to speak to the officials but there was no sustained protest.
