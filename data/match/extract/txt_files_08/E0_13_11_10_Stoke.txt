<title>Reds slump to Stoke loss</title>
<content>
Liverpool's four-match unbeaten run came to an end at the Britannia Stadium as Ricardo Fuller and Kenwyne Jones struck to give Stoke their second victory of the week.
The Potters started brightly and had a couple of confident penalty appeals turned down, while Dean Whitehead forced Pepe Reina into a fine save down low to his right.
The Reds gained a foothold in the game as the first half progressed but Stoke always provided a threat from set-pieces and eventually made the breakthrough on 56 minutes after a Rory Delap throw-in caused chaos in the box.
Liverpool could not clear the ball during an almighty goalmouth scramble and Fuller took advantage to poke home through a crowded box and fire Stoke in front.
Maxi Rodriguez came close to scoring an equaliser when his close-range effort was kept out by Asmir Begovic but otherwise Roy Hodgson's men carried little threat.
The outcome was put beyond any doubt in stoppage time when Jones made it 2-0 to Stoke on the break, while Lucas Leiva was sent off late on for a second bookable offence.
Liverpool's first 45 minutes appeared to be a direct continuation of the second half at Wigan, where they had found themselves under almost constant pressure and were lucky to come away with a draw.
Only the returning Sotirios Kyrgiakos had not played in the previous two matches so there may have been an element of fatigue, especially as Stoke played a day earlier on Tuesday.
But no team in the Premier League, let alone a club like Liverpool, can expect to use that as an excuse for an abject and disjointed first-half display.
Hodgson's side appeared unprepared and unable to deal with their hosts' brash, energetic approach which allowed them to dominate the game from first to last.
Stoke were appealing unsuccessfully for a penalty in only the second minute when Rodriguez leant heavily on Fuller as they challenged for Delap's long throw.
It was a sign of things to come as the visitors found themselves being forced back, looking worryingly susceptible to Delap's trademark set-piece.
Midfielder Whitehead benefited from weak headed clearances to fire in a low shot which Reina turned around a post and then drill a similar 30-yard effort just past the angle of upright and crossbar.
Jones and former Reds winger Jermaine Pennant also had chances before Steven Gerrard registered Liverpool's first shot in the 29th minute, forcing Begovic to tip the low effort behind, although the goalkeeper dealt more comfortably with Raul Meireles strike from the resulting corner.
It was a brief retort which was soon forgotten when Jones rounded Paul Konchesky to cross low into the six-yard box, forcing Jamie Carragher to dive in front of Matthew Etherington to prevent the opening goal.
Less than two minutes into the second half Fernando Torres, who had been anonymous previously, was booked for tackling Pennant from behind.
But the real threat was still coming from Delap and Liverpool's inability to cope with his party trick finally cost them in the 56th minute.
A scramble saw the ball break to Etherington at the far post and his cross-shot bounced back off Konchesky to Fuller, who had his first effort blocked but stabbed home the second from close range.
Despite the stereotype, it was Stoke's first goal from a Delap party-piece in 23 league matches.
Jones almost made it two when Martin Skrtel mistimed his jump but his left-footed effort beat both Reina and the far post.
Liverpool, as they did in the first half, had two chances in quick succession with Rodriguez shooting straight at Begovic from Dirk Kuyt's cut-back and Skrtel firing wide from Kyrgiakos' knockdown of Gerrard's free-kick.
David Ngog and Ryan Babel replaced Meireles and Rodriguez but with Liverpool still unable to gain decent possession of the ball it made little difference they effectively had four strikers on the pitch.
Their embarrassment was completed in the 90th minute when Gerrard gave the ball away and Jones was able to skip past Skrtel to fire home.
The dismissal of Lucas for a second bookable offence just compounded matters.
