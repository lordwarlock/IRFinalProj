<title>Lampard settles Ewood affair</title>
<content>
Frank Lampard scored the only goal of the game as Chelsea returned to winning ways with a 1-0 victory at Blackburn Rovers.
Rovers kept the visitors at bay in the first half, although seven minutes of injury time needed to be played due to Petr Cech's early nose injury.
Blackburn suffered another blow before half time when Chris Samba was unable to recover from a hamstring strain and he had to be replaced.
The deadlock was finally broken in the 51st minute when Branislav Ivanovic cut inside and delivered a cross with the outside of his right boot that Lampard dived to head home in the middle.
Rovers pressed late on and nearly levelled when Ivanovic headed against his own crossbar, while Fernando Torres missed a close-range effort to settle the contest.
Home fans were banned from displaying anti-Kean banners during the game so a plane circled Ewood Park trailing a banner which bore the slogan 'Steve Kean Out'.
The airborne distraction had provided the only memorable moment of a tepid first half in which Chelsea were restricted to a first-minute effort from Daniel Sturridge which was saved by Paul Robinson.
Blackburn almost went ahead in the ninth minute when Mauro Formica cut in from the right and crossed for Yakubu who stretched to prod the ball wide under pressure from the advancing Cech.
Cech required seven minutes of treatment for a facial injury in the resulting clash with the striker, during which time the Chelsea medical team worked to stem the flow of blood.
When play resumed, it was the home side who continued to press forward with confidence, with the increasingly impressive Ruben Rochina blazing wide from 20 yards.
The lively Sturridge failed a win a penalty when he fell under the challenge of Christopher Samba in the box, then moments later his cross from the left was just too strong for Juan Mata in front of goal.
Sturridge was caught narrowly offside racing onto a through-ball from Malouda then Lampard blazed over from 20 yards after a cross from Ivanovic.
Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas, desperate not to drop points which could leave them even further adrift of the Premier League summit, replaced the ineffective Malouda with Fernando Torres at the break.
But Rovers started the second period in lively fashion with Hoilett crossing in the box towards Formica, whose chance was foiled when Terry stabbed the ball away.
The visitors grabbed the lead in the 50th minute with only their second shot on target. Ivanovic turned inside Hoilett on the right and crossed for Lampard who directed a low header past Robinson.
But Rovers should have equalised four minutes later when Cech parried a Pedersen free-kick into the path of substitute Grant Hanley, who drilled the rebound straight into the prostrate keeper.
As the game belatedly sprang into life, Ramires had a goal-bound effort blocked in the box by Jason Lowe, then Lampard fired a long-ranger which was tipped over by Robinson.
Chelsea's defensive frailties were evident again in the 67th minute when Yakubu wriggled between Alex and John Terry before hitting a curling shot which Cech saved well.
Rovers had yet another chance to equalise in the 70th minute when Rochina found Formica in the right side of the Chelsea box and while his shot beat Cech it was booted clear by Ramires.
Then came Rovers' big chance four minutes from time when Pedersen swung in a corner and the ball ricocheted off the back of Ivanovic's head and against the underside of the bar.
