<title>Rampant Fulham hit QPR for six</title>
<content>
Andrew Johnson scored a hat-trick as Fulham recorded their first Premier League win of the season thanks to a sensational 6-0 win against neighbours QPR at Craven Cottage.
The hosts produced a blistering opening 45 minutes, scoring three times against their West London rivals.
Andrew Johnson scored his first two league goals of the campaign and his first was the fastest in the league this season, coming after just 78 seconds.
Bobby Zamora was allowed space down the right to find Moussa Dembele whose left-foot shot was parried by keeper Paddy Kenny but Johnson was on hand to slot the ball home.
Fulham soon doubled their lead from the penalty spot after Kenny clumsily felled goalscorer Johnson on the edge of the box and Danny Murphy made no mistake from 12 yards.
And seven minutes before the break, it was three as Zamora's low driven cross was tucked into the back of the net by his strike partner Johnson.
Just before the hour mark, Johnson completed his hat-trick - his first in seven years and his fifth goal in a game and a half, slotting home Murphy's quick free-kick.
The Cottagers were rampant now and Zamora's delightful flick was finished off by Dempsey with ease and the rout was completed when, in a role reversal, Zamora got his name on the scoresheet, firing home Dempsey's slide rule pass.
QPR looked poor in the rivals' first meeting since 2001 and hopes of securing their first win over Fulham since 1983 were all-but curtailed just before the break when Johnson tucked away his second of the afternoon.
The London derby started at ferocious pace, with Shaun Wright-Phillips' curled 20-yard effort forcing Mark Schwarzer to save within the opening minute.
Fulham immediately launched an attack at the other end and broke the deadlock.
Moussa Dembele played a neat one-two with Zamora before unleashing a fierce drive that Paddy Kenny could only parry onto Johnson, who finished with ease.
The rapid start to the match continued and the Cottagers came close to doubling their lead immediately afterwards as Fitz Hall almost flicked into his own net from Dempsey's squared ball.
The United States international then saw a goalbound effort blocked by a last-gasp challenge by Bradley Orr and, as the home side's onslaught continued, Johnson came agonisingly close to netting his second of the afternoon after firing a volley inches wide from a Zamora header in the 17th minute.
However, Fulham did not have to wait long to score their second as Kenny upended Johnson in the box and referee Andre Marriner awarded a 20th-minute penalty, which skipper Murphy duly converted.
The Hoops were struggling to cope with the home side's attack-minded philosophy and unable to turn their fleeting attacks into goal-scoring opportunities.
Fulham, meanwhile, showed no signs of a post-Europa League hangover and looked impressive in attack, with Steve Sidwell coming close in the 37th minute.
And just one minute later, Jol's side grabbed a third of the afternoon as Johnson turned home Zamora's cross after keeping a cool a head during a melee in the box.
QPR looked shell-shocked as they trudged off at the break and came out with two new faces as DJ Campbell and Tommy Smith replaced Adel Taarabt and Shaun Derry.
Warnock's attempts to gee up his side looked to be working at the start of the second period, with both Wright-Phillips and Alejandro Faurlin getting away shots.
However, Fulham were soon back in their stride and Kenny was forced to acrobatically save a Zamora effort in the 58th minute.
Sidwell had another attempt from the resulting corner and moments later Johnson ensured he would leave Craven Cottage with the matchball when he latched onto Murphy's quick free-kick.
Fulham did not rest on their laurels, though, and after Zamora fired just wide, the striker laid the ball off to Dempsey to make it 5-0 with an exquisite finish.
QPR's first top-flight match against Fulham got even worse in the 74th minute when Zamora was rewarded for an industrious performance with a deserved goal, slotting home past a hapless Kenny.
The only moment of joy for 3,000-odd visiting fans came just before Zamora's goal as they welcomed back striker Jamie Mackie, who came off the bench for the first time since suffering a double leg break in an FA Cup tie with Blackburn in January.
The former Plymouth striker skewed a shot wide as the game came to a close, while at the other end fellow substitute Bryan Ruiz saw an angle drive fly just wide before Marriner called time.
