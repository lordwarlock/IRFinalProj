<title>Roberts haunts Latics</title>

Jason Roberts scored against his old club as Blackburn beat Wigan to climb out of the drop zone and dump their North West rivals in it.
Charles N'Zogbia had a goal disallowed in a first half of few chances before Morten Gamst Pedersen scored the opener on 58 minutes from a free-kick from a tight angle which keeper Ali Al Habsi should perhaps have done better with.
Roberts then climbed off the bench to net the vital second on 67 minutes from Brett Emerton's cross, although the Wigan defenders appealed for offside.
N'Zogbia pulled one back with a fine free-kick from 30 yards with 16 minutes to go to set up a nervy finish, but Rovers held on to claim a vital victory and climb out of the drop zone.
In scoring, Roberts atoned for the error which had cost his side dear against Chelsea last weekend when he had missed a sitter against the champions in the 2-1 defeat.
But last week's stirring but ultimately fruitless performance against the Blues seemed a distant memory in a tepid first period which quickly seemed destined to finish goalless.
The home side's early chances came from Christopher Samba at set-pieces, while Wigan spurned the few chances they had, slamming two free-kicks into the Blackburn wall.
N'Zogbia showed a flash of skill to burst into the box where he was dispossessed by Gael Givet, while at the other end Al Habsi flapped at a Pedersen free-kick.
Mame Biram Diouf had the best early chance when he was played clear by Pedersen, only for the Wigan goalkeeper to burst from his goal and dive bravely at the striker's feet.
The more entertaining action came on the touchline where former Wigan defender Pascal Chimbonda was relishing the taunts of the visiting fans at the Darwen End.
Wigan had their first real shot on target in the 31st minute when Rodallega burst through on the left and hit a left-foot shot which Robinson saved well.
And as the visitors ended the half strongly, Rovers had a lucky escape in the 39th minute when N'Zogbia barged through to put the ball in the net, only to be pulled up for a foul on Pedersen.
The visitors continued in the ascendancy at the start of the second period with N'Zogbia serving up fine crosses which Hugo Rodallega and Steve Gohouri failed to convert.
But Al Habsi had to perform heroics to keep his side level in the 49th minute when Pedersen met Emerton's deep cross from the right and the goalkeeper made a superb reaction save.
Rovers grabbed the lead in the 58th minute when Pedersen's free-kick from out on the right touchline evaded everyone and curled into the top corner past Al Habsi.
The visitors had a half-hearted penalty appeal turned down when Rodallega tripped over Givet, but Rovers went further ahead in the 67th minute when Emerton crossed from the right and Roberts slotted home.
Wigan still looked lively and reduced their deficit when N'Zogbia drilled a low free-kick in off Robinson's left-hand post in the 74th minute.
