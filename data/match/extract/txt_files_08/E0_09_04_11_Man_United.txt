<title>Nani inspires United</title>

Nani inspired Manchester United to beat Fulham 2-0 and move 10 points clear at the top of the table and a step closer to a record 19th title.
The Portuguese ace made a great run through the Fulham defence to set up Dimitar Berbatov's opener on 12 minutes, although there was a hint of offside.
Nani then went around the advancing Mark Schwarzer before his shot was deflected by Aaron Hughes for Antonio Valencia to nod home just after the half hour mark.
The win sends Sir Alex Ferguson's side 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand.
There was no Grand National glory for Ferguson, whose horse What A Friend failed to land the honours at Aintree.
But in a football sense at least, it must be quite nice being Ferguson at the minute.
Robbed of Wayne Rooney's services for a couple of games thanks, in his eyes, to some unjust treatment from the Football Association, the United boss could just pluck another striker from his impressive roster.
In this instance it was Berbatov, the Premier League's top scorer and a man who bagged five in one game earlier this season.
The Bulgarian had only started one league game since that dismal defeat at Wolves over two months ago, the equally miserable loss at Liverpool. On home soil at least though, the striker is a man to be trusted.
Early on, it did look like he was cursing when Nani ran into a crowd of Fulham defenders on the edge of the area instead of playing a simple pass to the flanks.
But, making a mockery of his absence from the seven-man shortlist for PFA player of the year, Nani squeezed a pass to Anderson, then flicked the return to his left for Berbatov on 12 minutes.
TV replays indicated the striker was just offside. It was very tight though and Berbatov was not hanging around as he slotted his shot beyond Mark Schwarzer.
It was exactly what United were looking for so early in the contest and the points should have been wrapped up when Berbatov skipped past Carlos Salcido and Brede Hangeland by the touchline and burst into the box before rolling a pass back to Anderson.
Goalscoring, though, is not the returning Brazilian's forte. Back after a nine-match absence with a knee injury, Anderson never looked like improving a return of two goals in 121 previous appearances and dribbled a terrible effort wide.
United did get their second though, on 32 minutes when Schwarzer inexplicably raced to the touchline to try and make a clearance he was never going to manage given Nani had the speed to get there first.
The Portugal winger showed his selfish streak by going for goal himself rather than present Valencia with a tap-in.
Hughes did it instead, turning Nani's shot away with his head but merely offering Valencia the chance to nod home from close range as a consequence.
It was Valencia's first goal since the Community Shield and his return to action from a major ankle injury suffered one month later is another reason Ferguson has been rejoicing.
After an enterprising start, Fulham had been overwhelmed.
They retained enough spirit to bring an outstanding save from Tomasz Kuszczak, though, as substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen curled a shot goalwards from 25 yards.
It was a confusing piece of play all round as, from their angle, the Fulham fans thought it had gone in and referee Mike Jones awarded a goal-kick rather than the corner which would have been due reward for Kuszczak.
The game drifted onwards in such a mundane manner, Ferguson could have used the telephone installed in the directors' box to overcome communication problems during his five-match touchline ban to keep up with events at Liverpool.
He didn't though, limiting himself to a couple of conversations with coach Rene Meulensteen as he made the substitutions required to keep his players fresh for Tuesday's UEFA Champions League return with Chelsea.
Anderson and Berbatov were both denied by Schwarzer, the first after another uncharacteristic mistake from the veteran Australian.
By the end, even John O'Shea was trying his luck, advancing from his right-back role to let fly from the edge of the area.
