<title>City seal top-spot at Xmas</title>
<content>
Manchester City made sure they would be top at Christmas for the first time since 1929 as they comfortably beat Stoke City 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium.
Stoke never looked like causing the home side any major problems, and once Sergio Aguero had converted from close-range on the half-hour the result was never in doubt.
The lead was doubled not long after with Adam Johnson smashing home a wonderful 25-yard drive.
Aguero helped himself to a second early in the second-half to seal the win, which was never in doubt as Stoke never once troubled Joe Hart.
Roberto Mancini's men guaranteed they would sit on top of the top-flight at Christmas for the first time since before the second World War.
Kolo Toure had suggested earlier in the week that City had a secret plan for facing Stoke, it was the visitors, though, who had the weapon.
It was largely defensive though, with Pulis utilising four burly defenders, including Jonathan Woodgate at full-back, with another solid bank of four in front of them.
For a time it worked as City struggled to fashion a clear-cut opening.
Johnson did hit a thunderous effort against the bar but only thanks to a pretty hefty deflection off Marc Wilson.
It was a limited plan though, belying the fine run of form Stoke have suddenly found themselves in after a period in the doldrums.
And they were made to pay just before the half hour after Samir Nasri and David Silva worked a short corner routine that allowed the Spain star to race forward unopposed after his team-mate's dummy run had fooled two defenders.
Silva exploited the opportunity by slipping a pass through to Yaya Toure, who in turn squared into the six-yard area.
Thomas Sorensen was equal to Vincent Kompany's close-range effort but the Dane could only push the ball into the path of Aguero, who bundled home from barely a yard.
On the touchline, Tony Pulis was livid, believing the officials had missed an offside somewhere in the melee.
There did not seem to be a direct involvement of play at any stage though, and Pulis' ire was probably more to do with the knowledge that, once behind, Stoke were going to find it very difficult to fashion an equaliser.
Difficult became virtually impossible 10 minutes before the break when slack control from Jon Waters, who failed to kill Dean Whitehead's pass out of defence, allowing it to run onto Johnson.
The England winger did not require a second invitation, smashing a brutal effort through a packed penalty area, Sorensen partially unsighted as it flashed into the corner.
Johnson came close to bagging another just before the break when Sorensen unconvincingly shovelled his curling free-kick round the post.
The former Middlesbrough man was having a productive evening, although he was matched in that by Aguero, who after forcing Sorensen into another save, bagged his second.
It was a goal clinical in its efficiency as Gareth Barry slipped a pass out to Nasri, whose low cross from the right split the Stoke defenders and allowed Aguero to finish at the far post.
Aguero was 90 seconds too late to claim the Premier League's 20,000th goal but he nearly completed his hat-trick shortly afterwards, when he was sent through by Toure, but only succeeded in flicking his shot wide of the far post.
Blues manager Mancini took the opportunity to rotate his players, including replacing Silva with Mario Balotelli.
Although the game was winding down, Balotelli is not one for staying out of the way for long and was not happy when referee Mike Dean turned down his penalty appeal when Robert Huth used an arm to block a shot.
