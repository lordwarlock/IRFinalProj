<title>Gerrard rescues Reds</title>
<content>
Steven Gerrard rescued a point for Liverpool at home to Sunderland but the Reds' season continues to stutter with two more dropped Premier League points.
The Reds, as they have been so often in the past, were indebted to their skipper as he headed home Fernando Torres' excellent cross midway through the second period.
But the leveller could not paper over the cracks of a largely poor performance from the Anfield outfit, coming just three days following their humiliating Carling Cup exit at the hands of Northampton.
Liverpool took the lead with just five minutes on the clock as Michael Turner rolled a free-kick back towards Simon Mignolet, only for Torres to seize possession before squaring for Dirk Kuyt to slot home.
Sunderland were incensed, apparently aggrieved that Turner's pass was for Mignolet to take the set-piece, but referee Stuart Attwell allowed the goal to stand after consulting with his assistant.
The Black Cats were back on terms before the half-hour mark as Ahmed Elmohamady's cross was clearly handled in the box by Christian Poulsen, with Darren Bent stepping up to make no mistake from 12 yards.
Steve Bruce's men then stunned Anfield into silence at the start of the second period as Nedum Onuoha's glorious cross was headed home at the back post by Bent.
Liverpool needed some inspiration and it arrived in the form of captain Gerrard, before substitute Daniel Agger somehow headed wide in the seventh minute of added time when unmarked four yards from goal.
Torres also played his part early on but cut an increasingly frustrated figure as Liverpool seemed to go backwards.
Only two minutes in he had the ball in the net after controlling Gerrard's free-kick on his chest and volleying in only to be denied by a very marginal offside decision.
His next intervention three minutes later had far more impact, although he was given a huge helping hand by Attwell.
When Sunderland were awarded a free-kick 10 yards inside their half Turner tapped the ball back towards Mignolet, presumably intending for the goalkeeper to take it.
Torres turned to look at Attwell, who was in charge when Reading 'scored' at Watford on September 20 2008 despite the ball going yards wide of the post, who immediately waved play on.
Mignolet stood on the edge of his penalty area raising one arm aloft in the vain hope Torres would take pity but the 26-year-old was not in a sympathetic mood and rolled a pass for Kuyt, back in the side after a quicker-than-expected recovery from a shoulder injury, to slide a shot into the net.
Turner's challenge on the Spaniard in the 17th minute could have resulted in a penalty but, considering his earlier decision, the 27-year-old Attwell ignored appeals.
Everything seemed to be going in Liverpool's favour but, as has been the case on several occasions already this season, they conspired to shoot themselves in the foot.
Gerrard's weak header back towards his own goal would have put Bent in had Reina not dived feet-first to clear the danger.
If it was a warning to tighten up the Reds did not heed it as Attwell was called into action again in the 25th minute, although this time his decision was a little more straightforward as Elmohamady's cross hit Poulsen's arm and Bent's penalty went under Reina's body.
Things went from bad to worse as Paul Konchesky had to be replaced by makeshift left-back Agger before half-time and then Sunderland went ahead just after the interval.
Onuoha's right-wing cross was a good one but Glen Johnson was caught ball-watching the wrong side of Bent as the striker nipped in at the far post to head his side in front.
Even the usually reliable Reina was rattled, scuffing one clearance straight at Jordan Henderson who almost punished the error with a long-range shot.
Torres' temper was bubbling over and after diving in at Onuoha he was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card after visibly showing dissent to Attwell.
Hodgson made a positive substitution by replacing defensive midfielder Poulsen with striker David Ngog, bringing Meireles inside and moving Kuyt out to the right.
But with the game seemingly drifting away from them, Liverpool's two star players dragged them back into the contest midway through the half.
Torres beat Bramble close to the right touchline and swung over an inviting cross which Gerrard headed in.
The England midfielder was booked for catching Danny Welbeck in the face with his arm as they challenged for the ball as the atmosphere began to heat up.
Liverpool, at least, were now showing some desire and Ngog forced a low save out of Mignolet, Kuyt fired just wide, Turner cleared off the line from Ngog and Agger headed wide.
