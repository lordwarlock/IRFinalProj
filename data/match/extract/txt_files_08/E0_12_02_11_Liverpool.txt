<title>Reds rocked by Gohouri</title>
<content>
Liverpool's winning run was halted by Wigan on Saturday as Steve Gohouri grabbed a second-half leveller in a 1-1 draw.
The Reds led at Anfield courtesy of the in-form Raul Meireles, but were unable to make their pressure count and were ultimately left to rue a defensive lapse in concentration.
Luis Suarez, on his full debut, almost broke the deadlock early on but saw a brilliant curling effort clip the outside of the post.
Portuguese playmaker Meireles did find the back of the net after 24 minutes, crashing a cross from Fabio Aurelio past Ali Al Habsi on the volley.
Liverpool continued to probe from that point on, but much of their work was carried out in front of the Wigan back four.
That gave the Latics hope and they hit back on 65 minutes as Gohouri was left alone at the back post to turn a delivery from Charles N'Zogbia past Pepe Reina.
Suarez hit the woodwork again as Liverpool went in search of a winner, rattling the crossbar with a free-kick, but Kenny Dalglish's men were forced to settle for a point.
Suarez was into the action early, having a fourth-minute shout for a penalty turned down after a quick counter-attack from a corner and combining well down the right with Dirk Kuyt, who himself had a shot from the edge of the penalty area which had Al Habsi grasping to hang on at the second attempt.
But the Wigan goalkeeper could do nothing about Liverpool's opener in the 24th minute as Meireles continued his scoring run.
Aurelio's cross from the left by-line was partially deflected by the head of Gohouri but only as far as the Portugal international 16 yards out and he smashed home a right-foot volley.
Three minutes later Suarez almost doubled the lead with a manoeuvre reminiscent of the now-departed Fernando Torres.
He wriggled his way into the left edge of the penalty area before opening his body to shoot right-footed past Al Habsi only to see the ball rebound off the far post.
The Uruguayan was a willing outlet for Liverpool and Gohouri was booked on the half-hour for clattering into the back of him.
Wigan were in danger of being overwhelmed as Meireles continued to find space in and around their penalty area, blazing over from range on one occasion.
The closest the Latics came to producing a response was when winger N'Zogbia fired in a low free-kick which Reina claimed easily late in the first half.
Meireles was replaced by David Ngog four minutes into the second half, with the Portugal midfielder heading straight down the tunnel to receive treatment.
But Suarez showed no signs of fading in only his second match since 8th December and Antolin Alcaraz had to resort to a foul to prevent him racing into the penalty area, for which he was booked.
But Liverpool's inability to seize complete control of the game and score a second gave the visitors hope and the threat of an equaliser turned into a reality in the 65th minute.
N'Zogbia curled an inswinging left-footed cross from the right which found its way to Gohouri who stabbed home from two yards out at the far post.
There was a suspicion of offside but it was only relevant if Alcaraz had got the slightest of touches on the way through and it was impossible to tell.
That was the first goal Reina had conceded in five matches and it threatened to undermine all Liverpool's previous hard work in putting together a run of four successive victories.
Suarez continued to impress and when Caldwell fouled him on the edge of the area in the 77th minute he picked himself up to curl a shot over the wall but onto the crossbar.
The Uruguayan, seemingly almost single-handedly at times, tried desperately to find the winner but found Latics captain Caldwell in particularly resolute form.
Aurelio fired a shot just over, which was followed by Martin Skrtel's header in added time as the hosts failed to find a way through.
The result put a check, for now, on lofty ambitions to break back into the top four but despite dropping points Dalglish will still harbour hopes they can pose a challenge later in the season.
