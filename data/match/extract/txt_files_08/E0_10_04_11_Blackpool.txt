Arsenal got their title push back on track after surviving a Blackpool fightback at Bloomfield Road.
The Seasiders started the game brightly but the Gunners took the lead on 18 minutes via Abou Diaby from a Robin van Persie cross.
Three minutes later and Emmanuel Eboue doubled the advantage after a one-two with Jack Wilshere.
But plucky Blackpool pulled one back seven minutes after the interval through Gary Taylor-Fletcher.
Soon afterwards, Taylor-Fletcher had a great penalty shout after being caught by Laurent Koscielny in the box but referee Lee Mason waved play on.
The Seasiders were made to pay when Van Persie then slotted home with 14 minutes remaining to make sure of the win and reduce Manchester United's lead to seven points, with the Gunners having played a game less.
The afternoon started dramatically with Arsene Wenger forced to hand a last-minute place to veteran Jens Lehmann after Manuel Almunia injured his knee in the warm-up.
It was an unexpected 200th appearance in a Gunners jersey for the 41-year-old German, who was recently coaxed out of retirement to provide emergency cover in the title run-in.
The struggling Tangerines started brightly and had an early chance when Ian Evatt headed over from a Charlie Adam corner.
Andrey Arshavin and Van Persie put early shots over before Richard Kingson rushed out to deny Samir Nasri.
The Gunners then carved open the Blackpool defence with ease to claim a 18th-minute lead.
Fabregas picked out Van Persie with a superb cross-field ball and the Dutchman crossed for Diaby to sidefoot home from close range.
They grabbed a second just three minutes later as Eboue played a neat one-two into the box with Wilshere and then blasted past Kingson.
Blackpool enjoyed a little spell of possession but were unable to test Lehmann and Van Persie had the next chance when controlling another long Fabregas pass but shooting at Kingson.
The Blackpool keeper needed to be alert again to block an effort by the fleet-footed Nasri after more slick football by the Gunners.
Nasri had another opportunity seconds later when the ball was lobbed back into the box by Fabregas but his volley hit the bottom of the post.
Van Persie took the ball past the outrushing Kingson to set up Diaby but Stephen Crainey got back to tackle.
At the other end, Blackpool almost got one back just before the interval via DJ Campbell but Koscielny blocked.
The hosts, however, did reply after 52 minutes when Luke Varney was fouled but play proceeded and Jason Puncheon played in Campbell.
The striker appeared to be fouled by Lehmann as he closed in on goal but the referee allowed play to continue and the ball ran on for Taylor-Fletcher to fire home.
Blackpool were inspired and poured forward again.
Manager Ian Holloway was furious his side were denied a penalty when Taylor-Fletcher went down under a Koscielny challenge.
Taylor-Fletcher then headed wide as Blackpool maintained the pressure but Van Persie shot across the face of goal at the other end.
Arsenal made the game safe 14 minutes from time as they quickly turned defence into attack.
Campbell shaped to shoot for Blackpool but Sebastien Squillaci won possession and Fabregas released substitute Walcott down the right.
Blackpool struggled to get back and Walcott crossed low into the box and Van Persie made no mistake in front of goal.
Blackpool tried to set up a tight finish but Evatt headed at Lehmann and the Gunners eased to the final whistle to claim a vital win to get them back in the title race.
