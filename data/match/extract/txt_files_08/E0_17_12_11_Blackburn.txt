<title>Odemwingie bags Baggies winner</title>
<content>
West Brom claimed only their second win in seven Premier League games thanks to a 2-1 victory against Blackburn at Ewood Park to make it an unhappy one-year anniversary for under-fire Rovers manager Steve Kean.
Peter Odemwingie lashed home the winner with a fizzing right-foot shot in the last minute to secure all three points after James Morrison smashed in the opener before Scott Dann scrambled in an equaliser.
The Nigerian came closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening 45 minutes when he flashed Chris Brunt's wicked cross just wide of Paul Robinson's far post.
Rovers' best chance came late in the half when Morten Gamst Pedersen's left-foot curler was tipped over the crossbar by the ever-alert Ben Foster.
But seven minutes into the second half Albion broke the deadlock as Chris Brunt's corner was half-heartedly cleared by Steven Nzonzi and Morrison scored with a fierce volley from the edge of the box for only his second goal of the season.
However, Rovers hit back with 18 minutes remaining as Robinson's long free-kick downfield was headed back across goal by Christopher Samba for Dann to scramble the loose ball into the back of the net for his first goal for the club.
With the clock ticking down Odemwingie won the game after collecting the ball from a short throw and with defenders backing off, the Nigerian hit a stunning right-foot shot into the far corner.
This was a game Kean had had high hopes of taking all three points from, but it was a disappointing performance from his team, who remain 19th in the Premier League.
The Scot did not have to endure organised protests at a home match for the first time in a few months, but Rovers fans still made their unhappiness known, as chants of 'Kean Out' rang out around the ground after Odemwingie's goal.
The Baggies, meanwhile, are up to 13th and were deserved winners on the day.
The first chance of the game came to Odemwingie, who was released on the left by Morrison, but having cut into the box, he blazed the ball wide. Odemwingie's accuracy was also lacking on the quarter-hour mark as he glanced Brunt's cross wide when he really should have done better.
Two minutes later Ayegbeni Yakubu almost found himself in on goal at the other end, but could not stretch enough to make meaningful contact with the ball, and Odemwingie then tried his luck again, firing in an effort which Robinson turned around the post.
The hosts won a free-kick on the edge of the box which was curled goalwards by Pedersen and tipped over the bar by Foster. Brunt then delivered one for West Brom, Shane Long getting his head to it but sending the ball too high.
Blackburn survived a scare shortly after the restart when Scharner sent a shot bobbling inches wide of Robinson's post.
Their relief was short-lived though as an Albion corner came off Nzonzi to Morrison, who cracked a volley in from just outside the area to make it 1-0. Kean shuffled his pack by bringing on Jason Roberts and Grant Hanley for Simon Vukcevic and David Dunn, a move that drew cries of 'you don't know what you're doing' from some Rovers fans.
Dann then got away with an error of judgement, inadvertently lobbing Robinson when trying to play the ball back to his goalkeeper and grateful to see the ball bounce wide.
The former Birmingham defender made a far more positive contribution in the 72nd minute as he drew Rovers level, Samba heading on Robinson's long kick and Dann was on hand to bundle home.
There was another nervy moment for Blackburn as the ball ricocheted around their box, but Robinson pounced on it and Morrison then drove over the bar.
David Goodwillie, who had come on for Rochina, hit a shot straight at Foster, and Nzonzi and Yakubu were also denied.
Odemwingie then delivered the late hammer blow, dancing around several men before curling a beauty into the corner of the net.
This was the first of a vital double-header of home games for Blackburn and Kean will need something better from his team when they host Bolton on Tuesday if his reign at the club, which began 12 months ago, is to go on much longer.
