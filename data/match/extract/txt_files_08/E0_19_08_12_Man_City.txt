<title>City edge past Saints</title>
<content>
Champions Manchester City had to come from behind to earn a 3-2 win over Southampton in an exhilarating season opener at the Etihad Stadium.
City needed Samir Nasri's last goal to salvage the win, as they looked as if they would be on the end of a huge shock.
City had gone into the break 1-0 to the good courtesy of Carlos Tevez's opener just before the interval, although slightly fortunate given he appeared offside.
Nigel Adkins's men fought back and went ahead courtesy of two goals from two substitutes as Rickie Lambert levelled before Steve Davis put them ahead.
However, the Saints could not hang on as Edin Dzeko swept home the equaliser before Nasri fired home the winner with just ten-minutes left.
It was the second league game in succession that City won 3-2, as the match was a carbon copy of the never-to-be-forgotten final home game against QPR last season.
Of the team that started that momentous day in May, only Gareth Barry was missing from Roberto Mancini's starting line-up.
In his place, Jack Rodwell was introduced, although the debutant could do nothing to raise the tempo of a tepid opening with the only major incident being a worrying looking knee injury to Sergio Aguero.
The Argentina forward tumbled awkwardly under an early Nathanial Clyne tackle. Early reports were encouraging and Mancini can only hope the damage, in one of the least congested periods of the season, is not too bad.
absence when Tevez turned far too smartly for Josh Hooiveld, whose attempt to do something constructive just inside the area only sent his opponent to the turf and a penalty was given - but David Silva's poor effort was comfortably saved by Kelvin Davis.
These events, coupled with City's general lethargy, gave Southampton genuine hope of springing a surprise but they could not hang on until the interval.
Tevez could not have timed his run any better as Nasri spotted him about to dart beyond Saints' defence.
This time Jose Miguel Fonte was the defender who failed to keep tabs on his opponent, and Tevez made him pay by drilling a low shot into the near post, its power giving Davis no chance of keeping it out.
After the break City started quick with Dzeko, Gael Clichy and Silva all wasting excellent opportunities.
Southampton brought on Rickie Lambert for his Premier League debut and within minutes he levelled as he seized on a loose ball on the edge of the City box and guided it superbly into the corner of Joe Hart's goal.
Worse was to come for the hosts as when Rodwell gifted possession to Southampton inside his own half, allowing the visitors to pour forward. And another sub Davis took advantage to curl home.
The drama continued. Dzeko, who scored the stoppage-time equaliser against QPR, pulled City level with a first-time shot after Vincent Kompany's piledriver had been blocked.
