<title>Gabby grabs point at Everton</title>
<content>
A late Gabby Agbonlahor header rescued Aston Villa as they held Everton to a thrilling 2-2 draw at Goodison Park in the Premier League.
Everton held the advantage at the break thanks to a fine close-range finish from Leon Osman.
Stiliyan Petrov failed to clear just outside the area and the ball fell kindly to Tim Cahill whose reverse pass found the run of Osman who made no mistake from close range, slotting the ball into the bottom corner past Shay Given.
The hosts could so easily have added to their lead in the opening 45 minutes as Darren Bent cleared Phil Jagielka's towering header off the line.
Villa struggled in attack and Jack Rodwell's long-range strike took a heavy deflection off Fabian Delph and very nearly found the bottom corner.
The visitors came out firing on all cylinders in the second period and restored parity thanks to a stunning long-range effort from Petrov.
The Bulgarian picked up the ball 30 yards out before unleashing a curling effort which had keeper Tim Howard beaten all ends up.
However, the Toffees soon restored their lead when Fabian Delph climbed all over the back of Osman in the area attempting to head clear and referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot.
Leighton Baines made no mistake from 12 yards out, sending Given the wrong way.
But, just as the hosts thought they had secured all three points Marc Albrighton's inswinging cross was headed home by Agbonlahor allowing Villa to leave with an unlikley point.
The result left Everton frustrated after a fluid attacking display but their wholehearted performance at least put their off-field problems in the shade.
Both sides had talked up new signings but only one of them in Villa's Alan Hutton started the game.
Jermaine Jenas, who arrived with Hutton from Tottenham, was ruled out by a thigh injury while Everton left their loanees Royston Drenthe and Denis Stracqualursi on the bench.
With Ayegbeni Yakubu and Jermaine Beckford having also left the club recently and Louis Saha and Victor Anichebe injured, that meant Everton were starting without a recognised striker.
Yet it barely showed as Osman and Tim Cahill filled the forward roles superbly.
The Toffees attacked from the onset and appealed fruitlessly for a penalty inside the first minute when Osman went down under a Richard Dunne challenge.
Villa striker Bent then headed off his own line as Jagielka got forward to connect with a Baines corner from the right.
Baines stayed on the right and whipped in a low cross for Osman to turn and shoot but Shay Given instinctively stuck out a hand.
Jagielka headed another chance wide before Villa made a change after just 18 minutes when Emile Heskey left the field.
Everton were rewarded for their bright start after 19 minutes when Petrov and Dunne failed to clear a Seamus Coleman pass and Cahill squared for Osman to sidefoot home.
Substitute Barry Bannan, impressive for Scotland against Lithuania in midweek, had Villa's first serious attempt on goal after 30 minutes but Howard comfortably saved his 35-yard shot.
Everton continued to dictate the pace and Osman brought another good save from Given with a curling shot from the edge of the area after being set up by Marouane Fellaini.
Fellaini then tried his luck with a powerful left-foot shot which flew over the bar.
Villa had a lucky escape just before the break when a long-range
Rodwell shot was deflected narrowly wide by Delph with Given well beaten.
Villa started to show some urgency after the break but Fellaini ended a good run by Delph and Distin produced a fine tackle to deny Agbonlahor.
Everton were inches away from doubling their lead as Fellaini headed across goal and Jagielka in turn nodded narrowly over.
Yet Villa were enjoying a good spell and pulled level just after the hour when Petrov found space outside the area and curled a stunning shot inside Howard's left-hand post.
Villa were energised but Everton quickly responded.
Cahill brought a fine reaction save from Given as he met a Baines corner with a firm header but Jagielka was then bundled over by Delph.
Referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot and Baines stepped forward to tuck away the penalty.
Yet Villa were not finished and were freshened up by the introduction of Albrighton for Charles N'Zogbia.
The visitors equalised for a second time after 83 minutes as Agbonlahor again got forward and spread the ball wide for Albrighton.
The winger had time to curl a fine cross to the back post for Agbonlahor to jump and head past Howard from point-blank range.
Everton roused themselves for one last effort to snatch a winner but Cahill sidefooted wide after beating Given on the edge of the area and substitute Ross Barkley brought a fine fingertip save from the keeper.
