<title>Five-star Trotters go fourth</title>
<content>
Braces from Johan Elmander and Kevin Davies saw Bolton Wanderers beat Newcastle United 5-1 and move fourth in the table.
Owen Coyle's side went ahead when Davies scored from the spot in the 18th minute after ex-Bolton player Kevin Nolan had handled in the box.
Soon afterwards, Elmander went down under an off-the-ball incident with Mike Williamson but the Newcastle player received no punishment.
Chung-yong Lee then doubled Bolton's advantage on 39 minutes after Matt Taylor's free-kick struck the crossbar and Danny Simpson's clearance hit Elmander, sending the ball into Lee's path to slot home.
Elmander then added a third five minutes after the restart after rounding Tim Krul following Davies' incisive short pass.
But Andy Carroll gave Newcastle hope two minutes later when latching onto the ball and scoring after Stuart Holden had tackled Shola Ameobi.
Elmander put the issue beyond doubt, however, when out-muscling Fabricio Coloccini and slotting home on 72 minutes, before the Newcastle defender was sent off four minutes later for elbowing the Swede.
Carroll then hit the crossbar before Davies netted an injury-time penalty to complete the rout.
Nolan's first appearance at the Reebok Stadium since his 4million move to Newcastle in January last year had started with a rousing reception from the home fans but quickly turned sour as Chris Hughton's men slid to a big defeat.
But the Newcastle skipper could have given his side a dream start when he seized on a mistake by Paul Robinson soon after kick-off and cut into the box from the right before blazing a fine chance high and wide.
Carroll then crossed from the left to Ameobi at the far post who shot and drew a save from Jussi Jaaskelainen but referee Howard Webb had blown for offside.
Bolton began to get a grip on the game and had their first chance in the 15th minute when Lee crossed from the right and almost found Fabrice Muamba in front of goal.
Nolan's return got worse three minutes later when he handled an attempted cross by Lee in the box and Webb pointed to the spot, Davies striking low to Krul's left to give Bolton the lead.
With Bolton now well on top, Davies tried a left-foot snap-shot which Krul held at the second attempt, then he almost shrugged off the attention of three defenders to create a 27th minute chance before Simpson intervened.
The visitors fashioned a rare chance in the 31st minute when Jose Enrique got round the back of the Bolton defence and dribbled a deep cross which was missed in the box by Carroll, making a sluggish return from midweek England duty.
Williamson's foul on Elmander led to Bolton's second in the 39th minute. Taylor slammed his free-kick against the bar and as Newcastle blundered their attempts to clear, Simpson's kick hit Elmander, with the ball rebounding to Lee who fired low past Krul.
Lee came close to a second when he just failed to connect with a Davies cross, but Newcastle could have reduced the deficit in the last minute of the half when Carroll just missed a Danny Guthrie cross.
Bolton could have gone further ahead within two minutes of the restart when Taylor was given an alarming amount of space on the left but his cross towards the unmarked Davies was cut out by Enrique.
And the home side did make it three in the 50th minute when Lee fed Davies, whose superb short pass sent Elmander clear to coolly round Krul and convert his seventh goal of the season.
Newcastle reduced the deficit out of nowhere just two minutes later when Holden tackled Ameobi on the edge of the box and the ball fell to Carroll, who fired low to Jaaskelainen's left to give his side a glimmer of hope.
As the game continued to open up, Gary Cahill rammed a left-foot shot just wide from long range and the Magpies fired another warning with Jonas Gutierrez's left-wing cross just missing Nolan and the diving Carroll in the box.
Nolan was booked for barging Elmander as the pair chased a loose ball on the edge of the box before Taylor slammed the resulting free-kick into the wall as Coyle's men pushed for a match-winning fourth.
It duly arrived in the 72nd minute when Elmander was first to a long ball up-field from Jaaskelainen, shrugging off Coloccini before sliding the ball under the advancing Krul.
Things got worse for Newcastle in the 76th minute when Coloccini elbowed Elmander as they battled for possession down the right flank, and the full-back was red-carded by referee Webb.
