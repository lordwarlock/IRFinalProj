<title>Luis Suarez scored twice to help Liverpool to a 3-0 win over Wigan</title>
<content>
Luis Suarez continued his rich vein of form with two goals to help Liverpool to a 3-0 win over Wigan at Anfield.
The Uruguayan took his tally for the season to 13 goals with two second-half strikes with the impressive Jose Enrique netting the third with his first goal for the club.
The victory was well deserved for the home side after a dour first half with Wigan struggling to pose only problems to the returning Pepe Reina in the Liverpool goal.
The win is only Liverpool's second home success of the season in the Premier League to lift them up to 11th spot in the table.
In a quiet start to the game Liverpool had to wait until 23 minutes to create their first noteworthy effort as Suso let fly from the edge of the box and Al Habsi could only palm out his powerful shot.
The little Spaniard missed the best opening of the half on 32 minutes as Glen Johnson got to the byline and pulled a cross back for Suso who headed his effort over the crossbar from six yards out.
Both sides made changes to their midfield just past the half hour mark with David Jones replacing the injured Ben Watson following a collision with Raheem Sterling, while Brendan Rodgers appeared to make a tactical change by taking off Suso for Jordan Henderson.
Just before the break Al Habsi was forced into a smart save as Enrique tried to get onto Suarez's drilled cross across the six-yard box.
Whatever Rodgers said at half-time seemed to work as Liverpool broke the deadlock two minutes into the second half through Suarez.
Sterling capitalised on a poor pass from Jean Beausejour to round Maynor Figueroa and the England international picked out Suarez who fired his shot high into the net past Al Habsi.
Suarez made it 2-0 on 58 minutes when Enrique slipped him in on goal with a superb pass and the deadly striker poked his shot past Al Habsi.
Liverpool made it 3-0 on 65 minutes with Enrique grabbing a deserved goal for his afternoon's work, but there was some controversy in the build-up.
Wigan felt they should have had a throw-in when Ivan Ramis's pass appeared to be deflected into touch by Suarez, but the home side were awarded the throw and from it Sterling got in on goal and saw his powerful shot palmed out into the path of the grateful Enrique to snaffle up the rebound.
Liverpool missed further chances to add to their lead in the remaining minutes as they enjoyed their best day of the season at Anfield against a below-par Wigan.
