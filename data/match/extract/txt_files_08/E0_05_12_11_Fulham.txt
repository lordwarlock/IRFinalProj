<title>Dempsey downs Liverpool</title>
<content>
Liverpool's unbeaten run came to an abrupt halt at Fulham, with a forgettable night seeing them reduced to 10 men in a 1-0 Premier League defeat.
Clint Dempsey grabbed the only goal of the game for the Cottagers, with the hosts able to edge an entertaining encounter that swept from end-to-end.
Jordan Henderson came closest to forcing a breakthrough in the first half, but he saw a dipping effort cannon back off the post.
Liverpool continued to create opportunities after the interval, but saw their cause severely hampered on 72 minutes when Jay Spearing was dismissed for a lunging tackle on Moussa Dembele.
Dempsey then crashed the ball off the crossbar, before Mark Schzwarzer tipped a Stewart Downing effort onto the woodwork at the opposite end of the field.
It appeared as though the spoils would be shared as time ticked down, but Fulham snatched a winner five minutes from time when Jose Reina spilled a shot from Danny Murphy and Dempsey was on hand to turn the ball home from close range.
The result denied Liverpool a record-equalling seventh successive away win in all competitions as they endured their first defeat in 12 games.
They dominated long spells of the game yet their defence was unpicked with five minutes gone, Bryan Ruiz finding Dembele with a wonderful through-ball.
Dembele was through on goal but his first touch was disappointing, giving Reina the time to close down the space.
The lively start continued when Luis Suarez picked out Andy Carroll only for the England striker to stab his shot straight at Schwarzer.
Schwarzer was then forced to dive to his right to deny Charlie Adam following some inventive build-up play from Liverpool.
It was then Reina's turn to scramble across goal as Dembele directed a fine effort towards the bottom-left corner, and moments later Dempsey tested the Spaniard.
Liverpool were the more incisive side going forward, though they could ill-afford any lapses in concentration with Fulham showing flourishes in attack.
Henderson struck the right post having expertly glided his way into a shooting position and shortly after he combined with Carroll to set up a chance for Suarez that crept wide.
On two occasions Dempsey tried his luck from just outside the area, but Reina was alert to one while the second struck the advertising boards.
Suarez was hacked down on the edge of the area but Adam's kick was easily dealt with by Philippe Senderos.
Craig Bellamy brought down Dempsey, resulting in a face-off between the two with Fulham's American forward the aggressor, though referee Kevin Friend booked both players.
Jose Enrique fired a dangerous shot that Schwarzer did well to palm clear of danger as Liverpool controlled the early exchanges of the second half.
Fulham were lucky to escape a penalty in the 59th minute when Senderos brought down Adam.
The initial tackle appeared to have been made just outside the line, but contact continued well inside the area.
Friend was well positioned and refused to award a penalty with Bellamy hitting the free-kick into the wall.
Carroll, Liverpool's 35million signing from Newcastle, saw a shot head towards the corner flag and was taunted with chants of "what a waste of money".
Suarez had a goal disallowed and Liverpool's frustration boiled over in the 72nd minute when Spearing was sent off for his challenge on Dembele.
Dembele had the bit between his teeth as Fulham pushed for the winner, going close on two occasions.
At the other end substitute Downing hit the left post as a frantic climax beckoned.
The killer blow landed with five minutes of normal time remaining, starting with Murphy pulling the trigger from well outside the area.
