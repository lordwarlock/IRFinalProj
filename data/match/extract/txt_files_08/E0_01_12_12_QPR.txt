Harry Redknapp's first home game as QPR manager ended in stalemate as Aston Villa held them to a 1-1 draw at Loftus Road.
Villa took the lead against the run of play thanks to Brett Holman's piledriver, but Jamie Mackie restored parity with a deft header to rescue a point.
The result means Rangers equalled an unwanted Premier League record of 15 winless games at the start of the new season - an abysmal start that is only matched by the Swindon side of 1993/94.
The Rs boss had never previously lost a Premier League home debut as a manager, but that record looked under serious threat despite dominating early possession.
They were hit with a real sucker punch after eight minutes as Holman scored a first goal for Villa.
The Australian collected Ashley Westwood's pass on the edge of the area before unleashing a left-foot stunner past Robert Green, despite the goalkeeper's best efforts.
However, the Hoops hit back 10 minutes later as Mackie hit the target with a deft header into the far corner after excellent build-up play by Jose Bosingwa and Samba Diakite.
Shaun Wright-Phillips was unlucky not to give the hosts the lead soon after as his right-foot shot struck the base of the post with Brad Guzan beaten.
There were concerns late on in the half when Stephane Mbia was stretchered off after colliding with Gabby Agbonlahor in the middle of the park and the Cameroonian went to hospital for a precautionary check-up.
Clint Hill hit the crossbar with an 80th-minute header from an Adel Taarabt corner, but that was as close as they came in the second period as Paul Lambert's side defended resolutely and held on for a share of the spoils.
QPR are now seven points adrift of the safety line while Villa climbed above Sunderland into 16th position, albeit having played two games more.
