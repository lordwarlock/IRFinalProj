<title>City too strong for Wolves</title>
<content>
Premier League leaders Manchester City maintained their five-point lead at the top of the table courtesy of a 3-1 home win over Wolves.
Roberto Mancini's men were made to fight all the way and they only broke the deadlock when Edin Dzeko capitalised on a mistake from Wayne Hennessey.
The game looked dead and buried when Alexander Kolarov tapped home after David Silva's shot was blocked, but Wolves hit back.
Stephen Hunt netted from the penalty spot after Vincent Kompany had brought down Kevin Doyle, a foul that saw the defender given a red card.
Wolves pressed late on for a share of the spoils, but it was City who had the last laugh through substitute Andy Johnson in injury time.
Given what had happened when the sides met in midweek when City won 5-2 in the Carling Cup, many were expecting a comfortable afternoon for free-scoring City, but they endured a frustrating first half as they failed to make the most of the chances that came their way thanks both to Hennessey's efforts and their own poor finishing.
Wolves were only able to partially clear a corner from Kolarov in the second minute and the ball came to Samir Nasri, who unleashed a volley which Hennessey tipped over the bar.
At the other end, Hunt picked up possession following a mistake by Micah Richards and teed up Kevin Doyle, but the Republic of Ireland frontman could only flash his effort across the face of goal.
Sergio Aguero, having played a one-two with Silva, scuffed a shot high into the stands and Dzeko put the ball over after Wanderers skipper Roger Johnson had intercepted Richards' cross into the danger zone.
City continued to break forward and Aguero was just unable to meet a cross from the left after it took a deflection.
The Argentina forward then drew a good save out of Hennessey with a turn and strike from outside the box.
Moments later Aguero looked set to put City in front, but miskicked as he attempted to stroke home Richards' delivery and the shot went off-target.
Nasri showed little accuracy when trying his luck from distance and the same applied to an effort from Jamie O'Hara.
Silva saw his strike blocked after Nasri's cross came to him and City fans felt Richard Stearman had fouled Dzeko in the area as the ball came over, but referee Stuart Attwell waved for play to continue.
Four minutes before the break Silva put Dzeko through on goal, but the Bosnian's shot was turned around the post by Hennessey.
City kept the pressure up after the restart, with Nasri sending in a cross that bounced out off Silva, and with seven minutes of the second half gone, the hosts made the breakthrough as Hennessey - so dependable before the break - made a hash of dealing with a backpass.
Aguero came into to challenge the goalkeeper and the ball spun out to Dzeko, who lofted it into the net for his fifth goal in three games.
Wolves looked to respond but there was no-one to get on the end of Hunt's cross, and after Johnson had come on to replace Dzeko, Aguero sliced wide following good link-up play with Silva.
Two minutes later City had their second, Hennessey parrying Silva's shot from the edge of the box and Kolarov tucking away an easy finish.
Mancini brought on Mario Balotelli for Nasri and the Italian youngster sidefooted over the bar.
City appeared to be cruising, but they were then reduced to 10 men when Hart spilled a shot from Adlene Guedioura and Kompany was adjudged to have impeded Doyle as the forward attempted to get to the rebound.
