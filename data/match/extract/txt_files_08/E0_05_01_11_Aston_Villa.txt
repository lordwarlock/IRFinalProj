<title>Bardsley belter sinks Villa</title>
<content>
Aston Villa have dropped into the relegation zone of the Premier League following a 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland, with both sides finishing with 10 men.
Phil Bardsley's ferocious 80th minute drive was the difference, but Villa will rue the sending off of Emile Heskey, who received his marching orders shortly before the goal for violent conduct.
The Black Cats took advantage, but were reduced to 10 men themselves on 86 minutes, when substitute Boudewijn Zenden received his second yellow card of the game.
The decision sparked Villa into a late rally, but it was too little too late from the hosts, who slip into the drop zone for the first time since 2002.
Heskey was the Villain of the piece, missing two gilt-edged chances in a dire first-half before letting his frustrations get the better of him in the second.
For Sunderland, who had both David Meyler and Danny Welbeck stretchered off in the game, the result leaves them on course for a European finish in what was only their second away win of the season.
The first chance fell to Sunderland midfielder Steed Malbranque after Carlos Cuellar failed to make contact with a deep cross from Bardsley.
But Malbranque failed to test Brad Friedel with his header which drifted a couple of yards wide.
Kieran Richardson then became the first player to be yellow carded after five minutes when he brought down Villa striker Heskey in full flight.
Villa started to exert some pressure and Sunderland keeper Craig Gordon did well to finger-tip away a Stewart Downing free-kick under pressure.
A fine pass from Villa skipper Stiliyan Petrov allowed Nigel Reo-Coker a run at goal but he was halted by Malbranque's challenge.
Reo-Coker then played in Ashley Young but his first touch was poor and Craig Gordon was able to collect.
Bardsley produced a fine tackle inside his own box to deny Heskey after he had made a powerful run.
Ciaran Clark became the first Villa player to be yellow carded after 29 minutes for a reckless challenge on Jordan Henderson.
Clark's mistimed pass then almost proved costly as it was seized upon by David Meyler but Darren Bent was unable to make the most of his pass.
Sunderland were forced into a change after 38 minutes when Meyler pulled up suddenly, slumped to the ground and had to be stretchered off and he was replaced by Zenden.
Heskey, who played under Bruce at Birmingham and Wigan, was guilty of a glaring miss five minutes before half-time.
Downing did well to get to the by-line and shake of Zenden's challenge before sending a low ball across the box.
Heskey seemed certain to score but, from three yards out, he shot against the crossbar.
Sunderland skipper Titus Bramble was booked for holding back Heskey and the Villa striker then headed wide from Young's cross when well placed.
James Collins was booked in injury-time for a challenge on Danny Welbeck.
There was a quiet start to the second period but Malbranque could have broken the deadlock after 50 minutes.
Collins' clearing header lacked conviction and was nodded back down by Bent to Malbranque who volleyed over from eight yards out.
Collins came to the rescue in atoning for his own error three minutes later. He was shaken off the ball by Bent who went around Friedel but Collins recovered to block his shot on the line.
Sunderland were now in the ascendancy and Cuellar diverted a goalbound shot from Malbranque around the post.
But Sunderland were the more threatening and Friedel got his body behind Welbeck's stinging low drive.
Zenden was yellow carded for bringing down the powerful Heskey but Villa were reduced to 10 men after 68 minutes when Heskey was sent off.
Henderson appeared upset Heskey did not put the ball out of play so Asamoah Gyan could have treatment.
He responded by shoving Henderson in the face and was given his marching orders by referee Peter Walton.
With 10 minutes left Bardsley broke the deadlock with a low 25-yard drive after Zenden's free-kick had been blocked.
Welbeck was stretchered off after 83 minutes and replaced by Cristian Riveros.
