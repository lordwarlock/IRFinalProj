<title>Derby rivals draw blank</title>
<content>
Aston Villa and Wolves maintained their unbeaten starts to the new season after a largely disappointing 0-0 draw in the Midlands derby.
Though there was no faulting the effort on display at Villa Park, genuine moments of quality were rare and it will not be a local encounter that lives long in the memory.
Gabriel Agbonlahor often looked Villa's best outlet and one burst down the left in the first half resulted in Emile Heskey turning a low shot just wide of the post.
The tempo increased after the break, but clear-cut chances were still few and far between as Agbonlahor's low shot after a surging run was pushed out by Wayne Hennessey.
The Wolves keeper also had to be alert to tip Villa full-back Chris Herd's header over the bar and Hennessey was helpless three minutes from time when Darren Bent's header landed on the roof of the net.
Herd, though, could easily have been punished for a rash aerial challenge on Stephen Ward in the box late on as Wolves pushed late for a winner which would have been unjust on Villa.
The result sends Wolves top of the early Premier League table, if potentially only for a few hours, while Alex McLeish is continuing to enjoy a solid start to his reign at Villa Park.
Fabian Delph became the first player to be yellow carded for a rash touchline challenge on Matt Jarvis after only five minutes.
Villa's first chance fell to skipper Stiliyan Petrov but the Bulgaria international dragged his 20-yard drive wide.
Shay Given looked to be struggling with his recent groin problem but did well to block a downward Stephen Hunt header from Ward's deep centre.
Villa came close to taking the lead when the impressive Heskey dragged Agbonlahor's cross just wide at the near post.
Jamie O'Hara should have done better when he curled his shot over the bar after being teed up by Steven Fletcher.
Petrov got into a promising position near the by-line, despite Wolves appealing in vain for offside, but Hennessey was alert and brave in diving at the feet of Heskey from the resulting low centre.
Herd had half a chance when he was first to react to a Charles N'Zogbia corner but could not keep his header down before O'Hara was booked in first-half stoppage-time for chopping down Petrov.
Herd made an encouraging start to the second period and his teasing cross was only just too high for Heskey before the youngster then headed over the bar from a Petrov corner.
Agbonlahor outstripped Roger Johnson for pace and his low drive was turned aside by Hennessey.
Villa were now in the ascendancy and Kevin Doyle headed a Richard Dunne header off the line from Petrov's corner.
N'Zogbia was looking a threat and his centre created a chance for Herd, whose header was tipped over the bar by Hennessey.
Karl Henry was then yellow carded after 63 minutes for pulling back Petrov, and Wolves boss Mick McCarthy made a double change four minutes later with Kevin Foley and George Elokobi replacing wingers Jarvis and Hunt.
Wolves were caught napping at a short Petrov corner which found N'Zogbia in plenty of space, but he failed to take advantage and dragged his shot wide.
It was N'Zogbia's last contribution before being replaced by Barry Bannan.
Villa were still looking the more likely to score and Richard Stearman was booked after wrestling Agbonlahor to the ground.
