<title>Park double downs Wolves</title>
<content>
Manchester United kept the pressure on leaders Chelsea by beating Wolves 2-1 as Owen Hargreaves made a failed comeback from injury.
It looked like United were set to drop points once again from a winning position after Park Ji-sung's opener had been cancelled out by Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, but the South Korean struck for a second time just before the final whistle to secure the victory.
Hargreaves was handed a shock start but lasted just a few minutes before he pulled a muscle and had to be replaced, setting the tone for a disappointing first-half performance from United as Wolves began the brighter.
However, the Red Devils managed to take the lead against the run of play on the stroke of the interval as Darren Fletcher found Park with a clever pass and he slotted home.
Mick McCarthy, who made the headlines for his controversial team selection at Old Trafford last season, was rewarded for an adventurous substitution in the second half when Ebanks-Blake fired in an equaliser after 66 minutes.
Wolves then had an opportunity to take the lead but Steven Fletcher blazed over, and a late United onslaught finally paid dividends as Park scored with a superb solo effort.
But it was not all good news for United, with the future of Hargreaves again under scrutiny after the midfielder lasted just five minutes after starting for the first time since September 2008 before limping off with a hamstring injury.
The subject of Hargreaves' fitness has been the subject of debate for a number of weeks now.
At one point his Colorado-based surgeon Dr Richard Steadman claimed he was ready to play, only for Ferguson to step in and explain the midfielder had suffered a setback in his recovery programme.
Only a week ago, Sir Alex Ferguson suggested he had no idea when Hargreaves would return, so the midfielder's presence in the starting line-up was a big shock. His departure was probably less of a surprise.
After making a spirited start, the England star signalled to the bench he had a problem following an attempted cross from his right-wing station.
Hargreaves tried to continue but it was impossible and he made his way off, first to the touchline, then down the tunnel, a dejected figure, whose career is now thrown into fresh doubt, even though his latest setback is so obviously nothing to do with the dodgy knees that have kept him out for so long.
It is quite possible Hargreaves had gone before Fabio Capello, who had made the short trip south from Bolton, had even taken his seat.
The introduction of Bebe was an obvious move given the options Ferguson had at his disposal.
Yet United's team sheet appeared woefully weak. Just 35 appearances, before the game, for their front three, the vast majority of which had come as a substitute.
Wolves sensed their opponents were in trouble and once Richard Stearman had bravely blocked a Bebe shot, they pushed forward with intent.
Matt Jarvis was a particular threat and if Nemanja Vidic had diverted Nenad Milijas' 20-yard shot just inside, rather than outside, Edwin van der Sar's right-hand post, the stranded Dutchman could not have kept it out.
As it was, the game was still level when Darren Fletcher provided the pass of the first half, cutting in from the left before splitting the Wolves defence in two with a brilliant through ball that allowed Park to finish smartly.
After a disappointing start to the second period, Wolves finally gained their reward for all their industry when Ebanks-Blake was in the right place to intercept a Milijas shot, turn sharply round Vidic, then drive a fine shot through the legs of Van der Sar.
Under such circumstances, the introduction of Paul Scholes was an obvious move, so too that of Federico Macheda as Bebe joined that rare breed of substitutes who have been substituted themselves.
Yet the golden chance fell to a Wolves replacement as Fletcher found himself with a clear sight of United's goal following an ill-advised attempted clearance by Vidic.
Instead of calmly finding the net, the Scotland international rushed his chance and scooped it over.
Wolves thought they would at least be heading home with a point.
Then Park cut inside the area from the right wing two minutes into injury-time, and drove his shot past Hahnemann at the near post.
