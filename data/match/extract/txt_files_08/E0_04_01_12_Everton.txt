<title>Bolton win despite Howard goal</title>
<content>
Goalkeeper Tim Howard scored a sensational goal before Bolton turned the game on its head to pick up a vital 2-1 win at windswept Goodison Park.
Howard's 95-yard strike embarrassed his opposite number Adam Bogdan, bouncing just once before flying into the net to give Everton the lead just after the hour mark.
But the wonder goal only served to galvanise Owen Coyle's side and neat finishes from ex-Liverpool man David Ngog and Chelsea target Gary Cahill secured all three points for the Premier League strugglers.
The win lifts Bolton off the foot of the league and above Lancashire rivals Wigan and Blackburn. Coyle's men are now just a point from safety.
Everton, who lost Phil Jagielka through injury and were also denied a penalty claim for a foul on the returning Landon Donovan, remain in the bottom half of the table after their fifth home defeat of the season.
Donovan's first contribution was to win a free-kick in the opening minute which was curled into the danger zone by Leighton Baines but bounced harmlessly off Denis Stracqualursi and behind.
At the other end, Gretar Steinsson flashed a cross-shot across the face of goal, but it was the hosts who were looking more threatening in the blustery conditions as Donovan looped a header into Bogdan's arms and then cut the ball back for Stracqualursi, who fired wide.
Toffees striker Louis Saha was presented with an opportunity on the quarter-hour mark when Bolton centre-back Zat Knight inadvertently teed him up with a header from Baines' cross, but the Frenchman skewed his effort off target.
Steinsson tried his luck again only to find the side-netting and a Chris Eagles cross caused problems in the Everton area, Howard eventually tipping the ball over the bar.
The lively Donovan laid the ball to Leon Osman, whose shot from outside the box was gathered by Bogdan, and Knight slid in to beat Stracqualursi at the near post to Baines' centre.
Everton looked to have the momentum again, with Osman driving an attempt just wide, but it took a block from Phil Jagielka to deny Ngog.
Jagielka sustained an injury in the incident which led to him being substituted soon after, Jack Rodwell the man to take his place.
The Toffees were then left fuming in the 44th minute when Donovan went down in the box under the attentions of Sam Ricketts and referee Phil Dowd waved away their appeals for a penalty.
Moments later, though, they were indebted to Howard for keeping things level as he pushed Ngog's strike over the bar.
Three minutes after the restart Baines' corner came off Bogdan to Rodwell, who was unable to poke the ball in and like Osman, soon had to come off.
Howard then produced two good saves, tipping away efforts from Mark Davies and Ngog, before pulling off something even more spectacular.
The American lofted a huge kick down field which - assisted by the wind - travelled towards the Bolton box and bounced over the stranded Bogdan into the net.
It was another error of judgement on the part of Bogdan - who had made a couple of costly mistakes in his previous league appearance, the 5-1 defeat by Chelsea - and a shock blow for the visitors, but they responded well to equalise within four minutes, Ngog turning and slotting the ball into the corner.
Cahill then vindicated Coyle's decision to play him by snatching what proved to be the decisive goal.
Everton failed to clear a set-piece properly and Eagles laid the ball off to the England international, who fired past Howard.
Wanderers survived a scare at the death when Baines rattled the crossbar with a free-kick, but the ball was eventually scrambled away as three precious points were secured.
