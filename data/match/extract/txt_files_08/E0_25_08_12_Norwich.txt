<title>Honours even at Carrow Road</title>
<content>
Norwich and QPR offered positive responses to the 5-0 drubbings they suffered on the opening day, with a 1-1 draw allowing both to open their accounts for the season.
Simeon Jackson marked his recall to the Canaries' starting XI with the opening goal, but his effort was cancelled out by Bobby Zamora.
Chris Hughton's side started brightly at Carrow Road and broke the deadlock on 11 minutes when Anthony Pilkington provided the perfect cross for Jackson to bundle home from close range.
QPR's equaliser came against the run of play, with debutant Sebastien Bassong adjudged to have felled Djibril Cisse inside the box.
Cisse saw his spot-kick pushed onto the post by John Ruddy, but Zamora reacted quickest to turn the rebound into the back of the net.
Norwich came closest to snatching all three points in the second half, with Russell Martin seeing a looping header cannon back off the face of the crossbar.
Both managers made expected changes, as Norwich - thrashed at Fulham last time out - handed debuts to defenders Javier Garrido and Bassong.
Zamora and Armand Traore started for QPR, after their own 5-0 mauling by Swansea, with former Chelsea defender Jose Bosingwa on the bench.
The Canaries looked to counter quickly early on, but lacked a decisive pass from promising build-up.
Norwich got it right on 11 minutes when Jackson nodded the host in front.
The ball was worked from left to right through a series of one-touches by Jackson, captain Grant Holt and then Robert Snodgrass, who freed Pilkington on the overlap.
The former Huddersfield winger clipped the ball back across the six-yard box, where Canada forward Jackson nodded into the net.
Norwich continued on the offensive as QPR were forced to defend deep.
The visitors, however, were handed a lifeline on 20 minutes when Bassong tackled Cisse from behind, the QPR striker collapsing to the floor - and referee Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot.
Ruddy pushed Cisse's lacklustre penalty onto the upright, but Zamora was first to the rebound, tucking the ball inside the far post.
The injustice around Carrow Road was doubled when replays showed the QPR striker had encroached into the area before the penalty was taken.
Norwich, though, picked themselves up and were soon back on the offensive.
Snodgrass - one of three former Leeds players in the hosts' starting XI - weaved into the right side of the QPR box, but his low cross was booted clear.
Pilkington then tested Green with a low 20-yard strike.
After such a frantic spell, the tempo of the match then dropped moving towards half-time.
Robert Green thwarted his old club with a fine save to tip over Snodgrass' 25-yard drive which was set for the top corner.
QPR made a change at the start of the second half when Clint Hill, who had been in a running battle with Norwich captain Holt, was replaced by Nedum Onuoha.
Jackson dashed into the penalty area, but could only drill the ball into the side netting.
At the other end, Zamora's floated pass beat the offside trap to send Cisse clear, but he could not connect as the ball dropped through to Ruddy.
As the hour mark approached, Norwich had more of the possession, without really stretching the visitors' defence.
On 65 minutes, Snodgrass crossed from a free-kick on the right, but Bassong headed wide at the back post.
Jackson then just failed to connect with a diving header as the former Leeds man cut another ball back across goal, when he should have picked out Holt in space on the penalty spot.
Zamora had to go off for some treatment to a head wound following a challenge with Bassong, which the referee did not give as a foul.
With 20 minutes left, an unmarked Snodgrass headed a great chance over from Garrido's sweeping cross.
Norwich then had a free-kick on the right corner of the penalty box when Holt was bundled over by Anton Ferdinand, but the delivery was touched behind.
From the resulting corner, Russell Martin's looping header came back off the crossbar.
