<title>Blues leave it late at Rovers</title>
<content>
Chelsea came from behind to narrowly overthrow Blackburn 2-1 at Ewood Park on Saturday afternoon. 
The home side enjoyed a solid first half but were unable to hold on as Carlo Ancelotti's men maintained their five-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.
Rovers took a surprise early advantage courtesy of a Benjani header in the first half to put the reigning champions under pressure, but Nicolas Anelka came back to level the scores before the break.
Substitute Jason Roberts then came tantalisingly close to snatching a late goal but blundered his chance, paving the way for Branislav Ivanovic to grab a last-gasp game winner with a superb finish minutes later.
It was a cruel afternoon for Sam Allardyce's side, who enjoyed plenty of chances against the Blues, and the defeat sees them remain in the bottom half of the standings.
Starting the day five points clear at the top of the table, Ancelotti's men had headed north seemingly only concerned by the continued absence of Frank Lampard due to injury.
But any sense of superiority which may have pervaded the visiting dressing room was soon swept away as struggling Rovers launched an all-out assault.
At the end of a first period notable for its one-sided action, Allardyce's side could count themselves particularly unfortunate not to find themselves comfortably ahead.
Mame Biram Diouf and Brett Emerton were both denied shooting chances by the returning Alex before captain John Terry got a crucial block on a Morten Gamst Pedersen effort.
Moments later Mame Biram Diouf attempted an audacious lob over the back-pedalling Cech, who slipped but just managed to flap the ball out for a corner.
Benjani drilled a shot into Cech's legs before he grabbed the richly-deserved opener, rising highest to nod home a cross from El-Hadji Diouf.
The visitors looked strangely flat with Michael Essien coming closest with a long-range effort on 37 minutes, but they only needed one chance to pull level.
The equaliser arrived in the 39th minute at the end of a flowing move which saw Florent Malouda cross from the left to Didier Drogba, who headed down for Anelka to sweep home.
To their credit Rovers were far from rattled and continued to create chances in the second half, mostly through the lively and energetic Mame Biram Diouf.
But the visitors fired another warning that it would only take a second to turn the game in their favour when Drogba crossed for Ashley Cole to poke a left-footed shot just wide.
And Chelsea came close again on the hour when Drogba's cross from the right was stepped over by Malouda before Zhirkov drilled a low left-footed effort at Robinson.
Rovers should have regained the lead a minute later when Pedersen sent in a set-piece from the right which dribbled across goal before Mame Biram Diouf bundled it the wrong side of the post.
Moments after coming on as a substitute, Daniel Sturridge almost made an immediate impact when he ended a diagonal run with a crashing left-foot shot which flew into the side-netting.
But Rovers continued to press for a winner and it should have arrived in the 81st minute when Roberts turned inside Cole before shooting across Cech and wide of target.
