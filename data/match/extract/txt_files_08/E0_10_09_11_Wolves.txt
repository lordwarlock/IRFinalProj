<title>Adebayor scores on Spurs debut</title>
<content>
Second-half strikes from Emmanuel Adebayor and Jermain Defoe saw Tottenham Hotspur pick up their first Premier League points of the season as they defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 at Molineux on Saturday.
Debutants Scott Parker and Adebayor combined for the opening goal on 67 minutes as the Togolese striker slotted the ball home from close range.
And with just ten minutes of normal time remaining, Defoe drilled in a low shot past Wayne Hennessey to wrap up Spurs' maiden victory of the 2011/12 league campaign.
Both teams started the match brightly and were full of enthusiasm in the opening 45 minutes.
Parker set up an early chance for Defoe after dispossessing Karl Henry 30 yards from the Wolves goal but the England striker's shot was deflected wide.
Spurs were initially the more threatening and twice came close to taking the lead within a few seconds.
<b>First half action</b>
First Hennessey did well to deny Adebayor at close range and the follow-up effort from Niko Kranjcar was cleared off the line by Roger Johnson.
Wolves hit back and Brad Friedel had to be alert to beat out a powerful drive from former Spurs player Jamie O'Hara after Richard Stearman had caught Kranjcar in possession.
The Spurs goalkeeper then excelled in turning a low curling shot from Henry around the post at full stretch after a powerful run by the midfielder.
Wolves were now asking questions and Friedel held onto a Michael Kightly header from Kevin Doyle's cross.
Play was flowing from end to end and Ledley King's header bounced down and over the bar from a Kranjcar corner.
Adebayor had his first shot on goal after half an hour but he did not trouble Hennessey.
Defoe was looking sharp for the visitors and had a shot turned around the post by Hennessey while Gareth Bale dragged a shot into the side-netting in time added on.
Henry was being caught in possession too often and another lapse let in Adebayor, but Hennessey was alert and able to hack the ball clear from the on-loan forward.
O'Hara tried his luck with a volley from just outside the box but it was easily dealt with by Friedel.
Adebayor managed to get in a shot despite the attention of three defenders but it was deflected over the bar.
<b>Deadlock broken</b>
But he was not to be denied and put Spurs ahead after 67 minutes. Parker supplied the vital pass and Adebayor took the ball around Hennessey before netting from close range.
Wolves tried to retaliate and Parker was booked for bringing down Kightly in a promising position.
Kightly and Stephen Hunt were replaced by Adam Hammill and Matthew Jarvis in a double change by Mick McCarthy.
Hammill was immediately yellow-carded for bringing down Parker before Spurs doubled their lead. Defoe played a one-two with Kranjcar before drilling a low shot past Hennessey.
The defeat was Wolves' first of the season following two wins and a draw in three matches.
