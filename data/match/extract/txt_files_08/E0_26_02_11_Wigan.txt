<title>Hernandez double crushes Wigan</title>
<content>
Javier Hernandez scored two as Manchester United ran riot on their travels to thump a resilient Wigan Athletic 4-0.
The Mexican was brought in to start the game at the DW Stadium ahead of Dimitar Berbatov with Sir Alex Ferguson having one eye on the games against Chelsea and Liverpool coming up.
The 22-year-old wasted no time in getting on the scoresheet as he finished off a well-worked Red Devils counter down the left and poked home a Nani pull-back in the 17th minute.
Edwin van der Sar was on top form to deny Victor Moses, and Charles N'Zogbia looked threatening for the Latics but were again undone in the second half by United's power in front of goal as Hernandez slotted in another.
Berbatov and Darron Gibson came on in the second half and the two combined to set up Wayne Rooney for the third before another substitute Fabio then found himself unmarked at the far post to curl it past Ali Al Habsi for 4-0.
All eyes were on Hernandez's performance for the visitors, but it was also a game in which veteran Van der Sar shone for United with a fantastic first-half save from Moses after a poor back-pass from the usually reliable Paul Scholes.
And again the Dutchman was on top form to deny James McCarthy from six yards out.
Hernandez came into life early on in a high-tempo game and wriggled away from his marker but Al Habsi stopped the young striker in his tracks.
That earlier chance seemed to spur on the forward and having spun away from his marker, he steered in a Nani cross from close range for the opener.
Wigan, who were unchanged from their draw against Liverpool, started the game well and were by no means out of the tie with feisty duels taking place all over the park in particular between John O'Shea and Moses and Scholes and McCarthy.
Roberto Martinez will feel aggrieved nothing more was done following an off-the-ball Rooney challenge on McCarthy, however referee Mark Clattenburg did not brandish a card.
United soon began to control the game and went into the interval comfortably 1-0 up in the tie.
Wigan began the second half much like the first with fast-paced attacks and made good use of spreading their play between the midfield force of Mohamed Diame, Ben Watson, McCarthy and Moses.
Their threatening attacks nearly paid off as Van der Sar was at full stretch to tip away a Maynor Figueroa strike.
Nani then could have and should have doubled the visitors' lead but he thrashed his fierce effort into the side-netting. That chance was not long after Al Habsi had parried his earlier strike.
Al Habsi was called into action again and touched Nani's curling shot into the path of Rooney who opted to lay the ball back to the advancing Darren Fletcher. However the Scotsman's placed effort failed to beat the numerous bodies on the line which represented how hard-working Wigan were throughout the game.
The Red Devils' Dutch shot-stopper helped United double their lead when his kick fell into Hernandez's feet who cushioned a pass to Rooney.
The Mexican spun away from his marker and latched on to Rooney's through ball to slot past Al Habsi in the 74th minute.
Wigan were all but done when substitutes Gibson and Berbatov combined to find Rooney at the far post who had the simplest of tap-ins from just yards out with six minutes remaining.
The fourth came from an unlikely source when third substitute Fabio collected Fletcher's deep cross, shifted the ball on to his right foot and curled it into the bottom corner three minutes later.
