<title>Blues crush struggling Hammers</title>
<content>
Chelsea continued their strong start to the season and piled more woe on West Ham as they celebrated a 3-1 victory at Upton Park. 
The triumph gave the Blues their fourth win this term while at the same time condemning the floundering Hammers to their fourth defeat.
Michael Essien took just over a minute to open the Blues' scoring account as he made the most of a Didier Drogba corner to nod in from in front of the goal. Carlton Cole got the last touch in a vain attempt to keep out the attempt but Essien deserved full credit for the powerful header.
Salomon Kalou then took advantage of a sloppy Robert Green error to notch Chelsea's second goal in the 18th minute and make it 2-0.
That ended the scoring for the first half but Essien struck again late in the game as a stunning Paulo Ferreira cross set him up to nod a superb header past Green.
Scott Parker managed to pull one back for the Hammers just two minutes later but it was no more than a consolation goal as their dismal start to the season continued.
Chelsea's victory over their London rivals piled more pressure on under-fire manager Avram Grant, whose side remained rooted to the foot of the table without a single point from their opening four games and having conceded 12 goals.
In contrast, Carlo Ancelotti's team have now scored 17 and conceded just once, and their domination of this game began as early as the second minute when debutant Ramires won a corner on the left flank.
Essien rose above two defenders to head home Drogba's cross to silence the home fans.
West Ham almost equalised moments later when new signing Victor Obinna sent a close-range effort straight at Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech.
The visitors went 2-0 up in the 18th minute, though, when West Ham's England goalkeeper Green spilled a 30-yard Drogba free-kick.
Defender Matthew Upson tried to clear the loose ball but it cannoned back off Chelsea's Ivory Coast striker Kalou and over the head of the stricken Green.
Kalou went close to grabbing his second in the 21st minute but his shot was deflected around the post, much to the relief of the grounded Green.
Another corner from Drogba caused panic in the home defence but this time John Terry's effort was collected easily by Green.
West Ham should have pulled one back in the 27th minute but the unmarked Obinna put his volley wide from eight yards.
The Hammers striker then sent a curling shot just wide of the target after cutting in from the left wing.
Chelsea almost extended their lead when another Drogba corner fell to Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel.
His rising drive from 20 yards slammed against the angle of Green's left upright and the crossbar.
Chelsea received a scare in the 35th minute when Terry went down under a challenge from Carlton Cole, but the England defender continued after lengthy treatment - much to the disappointment of the home fans.
Ashley Cole became the first name in Chris Foy's notebook in the 40th minute when he was shown the yellow card for a foul on Herita Ilunga.
In the 43rd minute, Cech had to punch away a cross-shot from Ilunga as West Ham looked in vain for a way back into the game.
They almost succeeded in stoppage-time but Carlton Cole's effort was ruled offside.
Ramires should have troubled Green in the 50th minute but fired over from the edge of the penalty area as Chelsea continued to dominate proceedings.
West Ham tried hard to lift the tempo of the game and substitute Kieron Dyer, on at half-time for Luis Boa Morte, almost broke through with a clever run into the six-yard box.
Chelsea almost made it three on the hour when Kalou collected a fine pass from Drogba only to send his curling shot inches wide of Green's right-hand post.
The visitors had clearly settled for the three points as there was little urgency in their play.
When they did show some ambition, Drogba forced Green into a fine save with a 20-yard shot.
Branislav Ivanovic was booked in the 64th minute for bringing down Carlton
Cole.
A cross from Obinna three minutes later then found only the hands of Cech, much to the growing frustration of the home fans.
Mark Noble then sent a long-range effort just wide of Cech's right-hand post but the home side still lacked the killer touch.
Chelsea made it 3-0 in the 83rd minute when Essien headed home Ferreira's cross but moments later they conceded their first goal of the season when Parker calmly lobbed Cech from 20 yards.
