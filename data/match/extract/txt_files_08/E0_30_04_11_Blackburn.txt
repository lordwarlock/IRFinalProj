<title>Olsson goal topples Trotters</title>
<content>
Martin Olsson's first-half goal ensured Blackburn earned a crucial three points with a 1-0 win over Bolton at Ewood Park on Saturday.
The win lifts Rovers three points above the relegation zone and, with visits to relegation rivals West Ham and Wolves still upcoming, could prove crucial to their survival bid.
Olsson put in a man-of-the-match display, and it was his goal on 20 minutes which settled the contest, as he stabbed home a neat finish after taking on the Bolton defence.
The result also eases the pressure on boss Steve Kean, who had failed to lead his side to victory in their previous 10 games, following their first win since January.
Bolton might have gone in front earlier with Rodrigo Moreno's snap-shot coming back off a post, but they were always second best.
Bolton boss Owen Coyle made four changes to his side following the 3-0 defeat at Fulham in midweek, most notably Hungarian Adam Bogdan coming in for Jussi Jaaskelainen in goal with the veteran Finn dropping to the bench.
In the first attack, Olsson sent in a deep cross from the left which was headed back inside by Brett Emerton but Benjani stabbed the ball wide under pressure from Zat Knight.
Olsson was looking dangerous down the left and he got to the byline, putting in another cross which Emerton scuffed low and straight at Bogdan.
Blackburn almost went in front in the 15th minute when Olsson beat David Wheater on his outside in the area to give himself a shooting chance, but his effort was blocked on the line by Paul Robinson before a free-kick allowed Wanderers to clear their lines.
The woodwork came to Blackburn's rescue moments later, though, when Michel Salgado's misdirected header fell to the feet of Moreno, whose snap-shot came back off the near post.
But fittingly it was Olsson who scored the first goal in the 22nd minute to put the hosts ahead.
He picked the ball up 25 yards out and, with Wheater backing off, cut inside before toe-poking the ball into the near bottom corner from just outside the area.
Olsson appeared on a one-man mission to save Blackburn from the drop and, after having an effort blocked, saw his follow-up shot turned round the post by Bogdan.
Rovers were dominant now and only a fine sliding tackle from Knight prevented Emerton from breaking into the area.
There was a scare for the hosts when Olsson had to go off after taking a blow to his ankle, but after treatment he was fit to continue.
Emerton had Bogdan worried soon after the restart when, instead of crossing, he went for the near top corner with a free-kick way out on the left, but it dropped just over the bar.
Benjani should have doubled Rovers' lead after the ball fell to him in the six-yard box, but he could not bring it under control and Bogdan smothered.
Salgado was then forced off after hurting himself in a challenge with Gardner and Mame Diouf came on.
Steven Nzonzi almost added to Blackburn's lead when he got to Paul Robinson's long free-kick ahead of Bogdan but his looping header dropped wide.
Diouf was guilty of a glaring miss when the ball fell to him 10 yards out and with time to measure his shot, but he miscued it horribly high and wide.
Rovers were opening their opponents up almost at will, though, and the impressive Jermaine Jones sent a cross-shot just wide after a swift break.
