<title>:Premier League: Saido Berahino strike sees West Brom beat Hull 1-0

<content>:
A second-half strike from Saido Berahino gave West Brom a narrow 1-0 win over Hull, in Tony Pulis' first league game in charge. 

In a match where clear cut chances were few and far between, Berahino smashed home Victor Anichebes indirect free-kick from inside the area in the 78th minute, after Allan McGregor had handled Ahmed Elmohamadys needless back-pass.





Hull City, forced into two first-half substitutions as strikers Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez both went off injured, rarely threatened Ben Foster in the home goal.


Brown Ideye should have put West Brom ahead late on in the first half, but dragged his effort wide of the post when one-on-one with McGregor.

Berahino continued to pressure the Hull defence in the second half, although there was no West Brom team-mate to latch on to his drilled ball across the six yard box in the 51st minute.
