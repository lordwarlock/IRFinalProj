But the home side equalised before half-time when Stevan Jovetic turned in a Jesus Navas cross and Gael Clichy also hit the post from distance before the break.



Pressure has been on Manuel Pellegrinis during a poor run of late in all competitions, and they had to dig deep to find a seventh Premier League win of the season.



The pressure was ramped up when Dyer flicked the ball over the back-four to release Bony, who controlled brilliantly on his chest and caressed home the opener.



But City responded like the champions and they should have been ahead at the break after Jovetic equalised, with Sergio Aguero also going close alongside Clichys long-range strike that hit the woodwork.
                


The home side dominated the second half and had numerous chances to put the game beyond the Swans  but it was left up to Toure to grab the winner.

Swansea almost had an equaliser in stoppage time when Jonjo Shelvey's free-kick was deflected off the wall just millimetres past the far post.
