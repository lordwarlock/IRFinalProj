<title>Premier League: Aston Villa win 1-0 at Crystal Palace, their first victory since September</title>

Aston Villa finally ended a nine-match winless run as Christian Benteke's superb first-half strike snatched a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace.

Neil Warnock's side paid the price for failing to convert dominance into goals, although they found Villa keeper Brad Guzan in inspiring form throughout an entertaining battle at Selhurst Park.

Benteke's first goal in nine months on his return from suspension handed Palace their fifth defeat in eight games, but the home side will be left to reflect on their lack of composure in the final third after dominating the majority of the match.

Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie were constant threats to the Villa defence from the first whistle, but time and again the final ball was poorly-executed to the immense frustration of the vibrant home faithful.
Zaha, in particular, gave Aly Cissokho a rough ride in the early stages and forced a series of corners, while Palace had the ball in the net in the sixth minute only to be denied by the offside flag.

Guzan spilled a poor cross from Bolasie, but Dwight Gayle had strayed offside ahead of attempting to stab home the loose ball before Scott Dann rifled into the roof of the net.

The Villa goalkeeper was alert to keep out a deflection from Cissokho after Gayle had failed to connect with Joel Ward's long ball, while Mile Jedinak's ambitious back-flick was also dealt with by Guzan.

Benteke then left Dann trailing with a sublime turn on the edge of the Palace box, but his curling effort was palmed away by Julian Speroni and Guzan stood firm again as he held a decent strike from Martin Kelly.
