<title>Premier League: West Ham take all three points from West Brom </title>
<content>
West Ham continued their impressive start to the season at the expense of West Brom with a comfortable 2-1 win at The Hawthorns. 

The defeat pushes the Baggies further into the mire, and heaps the pressure on boss Alan Irvine.

The home side had taken the lead just 10 minutes into the game through Craig Dawson; and it seemed to knock the confident Hammers who started the day in fifth.
James Tomkins nightmare start was compounded when he was beaten for pace by the recalled Victor Anichebe, and Dawson evaded the visiting defence to head home.

But West Brom could not maintain their lively start and the Londoners grew into the game with captain Kevin Nolan getting more involved alongside striker Andy Carroll.

It wasnt long before they levelled and it was through that man Nolan. Just after the half an hour mark, Ben Foster parried Carrolls bicycle-kick and Nolan headed home.
