<title>Premier League: Manchester United defeat Stoke City 2-1 at Old Trafford</title>

Manchester United recorded a fourth successive Premier League win after a 2-1 win against Stoke City at Old Trafford.

Things seemed to be going United's way when Marouane Fellaini bagged his first Old Trafford goal in a red shirt with a towering header at the back post.

But Stoke hit back when Steven Nzonzi rifled home his stinging drive into the far corner for his first Premier League goal of the season and his first goal anywhere since March to make it 1-1 at the break.

There was some debate about who scored the winning goal as Juan Mata's free-kick looked to go straight through a crowd of players although Marcos Rojo claimed that he got the all-important touch.
Then, in a nerve-jangling finishDavid de Gea made a stunning save to deny Mame Biram Diouf and then Ashley Young came to United's rescue with a sensational goal line clearance in the fourth minute of stoppage time as the hosts held on to move to within a point of third-placed Southampton.

It was not until United were gifted an opportunity after 17 minutes that they came to life, as Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic passed to Robin van Persie.

The Dutchman powered into the box and pulled back to Herrera but the Spaniard was too hasty and shot over.

AnderHerrera quickly made amends for that miss as four minutes later he collected a pass from Mata and lofted a dangerous cross for Fellaini at the back post.

Erik Pieters failed to pick up the Belgian, who timed his leap superbly to head past a helpless Begovic.

United also had a good appeal for a penalty turned down as James Wilson - starting in place of the injured Wayne Rooney - appeared to be kicked by Geoff Cameron but referee Jon Moss gave nothing.
                
Stoke tried to respond and Pieters whipped in a good ball from the left looking for Stephen Ireland or Bojan Krkic, but Rojo intervened.

It was clear Stoke were not prepared to surrender in the manner Hull did at the same ground on Saturday and they pulled back level before the break.

Controversy arose as Fellaini went down clutching his neck as Assaidi won a 50-50 ball.

Assaidi may have caught the United midfielder on the hand or top of the thigh in the challenge but not his neck, as the Belgian appeared to claim.

Whatever occurred, Moss saw nothing untoward and both sides played on.
