City win relegates Wolves
Manchester City have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United to three points with a 2-0 win over Wolves, who have been relegated.
Terry Connor's strugglers needed to win to maintain their faint hopes of avoiding the drop, but goals either side of half-time from Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri sealed their fate.
City opened the scoring in the 27th minute when Aguero controlled Gael Clichy's cross before slotting home past Dorus de Vries, who was making his Premier League debut for Wolves.
The home side made the visitors sweat for much of the second half prior to the title-chasers settling the contest in the 74th minute when Nasri stroked home their second from Carlos Tevez's quickly-taken free-kick.
The defeat means Wolves cannot avoid finishing outside the drop zone with just three matches remaining while City have the Premier League title back in their own hands.
Tevez, fresh from his hat-trick against Norwich, had the first attempt on goal and was only just too high with a dipping 25 yard drive.
Wolves retaliated and Sebastien Bassong had a shot deflected wide after Michael Kightly's corner had been half cleared.
Aguero beat the offside trap and drilled a low shot inches wide of the far post.
City keeper Joe Hart had to be alert to parry aside a 20-yard drive from David Davis.
Nasri spurned a good chance to put City ahead after 16 minutes when he shot wide after being found in space by Pablo Zabaleta.
City started to enjoy the bulk of possession and a mis-placed headed back pass from Richard Stearman played in Aguero, who opted for a first time flick which went wide.
Aguero was then just off target from 15 yards as gaps started to appear in the Wolves back four.
But after 27 minutes Aguero put City ahead with his 29th goal of the campaign.
Gael Clichy made good ground down the left before picking out the run of Aguero with a pinpoint cross.
He had time to bring the ball down before slotting his shot past De Vries into the corner of the net.
City were now in total control and Aguero teed up Tevez but his curling effort flew straight at De Vries.
Bassong blocked a shot from Tevez, while Nasri flashed a dangerous ball across the box.
Yaya Toure became the first player to be booked after 55 minutes for chopping down Kightly.
Wolves were showing plenty of spirit and Hart was called into action to turn aside a Fletcher header after Bassong had won the initial aerial battle.
Tevez twisted and turned before sending a dangerous ball across the six yard box but no-one was on hand to apply the finishing touch.
City kept searching for the second goal but Stearman did well to block a low shot from Tevez.
After 74 minutes Nasri put the outcome beyond doubt.
Tevez was fouled by Davis, took the free-kick himself and exchanged passes with Clichy before finding Nasri in space.
He had time to drill a low shot into the opposite corner of the net.
