'''Gareth Ian "Gary" Ablett''' (19 November 1965 – 1 January 2012) was an English professional [[association football|footballer]] and manager. He played as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] from 1985 until 2001. He spent nine years with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and went on to win the [[FA Cup]] with their city rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 1995. He also played for [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Long Island Rough Riders]].

He moved into coaching and managed [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves]], and later spent a year as manager of [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. 

Ablett died on 1 January 2012, following a 16-month battle with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], at his home in [[Tarleton]], Lancashire. He was 46 years old.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/liverpool-v-everton-gary-ablett-789059 |title="He’ll be looking down on us all": Widow's emotional tribute to Gary Ablett on eve of FA Cup semi-final|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Liverpool===
[[Liverpool]]-born Ablett joined Liverpool F.C. as an apprentice upon leaving [[St Margaret's C of E High School (Liverpool)|St Margaret's Church of England High School]] in 1982.
He finally made his Liverpool debut on 20 December 1986 in a goalless league away draw with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], when regular defenders [[Barry Venison]] and [[Mark Lawrenson]] were absent due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1560|title=Charlton Athletic 0 – 0 Liverpool|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> He made five more appearances that season, scoring what would be his only goal for the club on 18 April 1987 in a 3–0 home league victory over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_Id=1584|title=Liverpool 3 – 0 Nottingham Forest|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>
Alongside experienced players in defence, such as [[Gary Gillespie]], [[Steve Nicol]] and skipper [[Alan Hansen]], Ablett helped Liverpool win the [[FA Premier League|League championship]] and reach the [[1988 FA Cup Final]]. Ablett only collected a runners-up medal in the latter competition due to Liverpool's 1–0 defeat by [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/viewgame.asp?game_id=1639|title=Liverpool 0 – 1 Wimbledon|date=|work=LFC History|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref>

In [[1988-89 in English football|1988–89]], Liverpool made it to their second consecutive FA Cup final. This time they were successful, after a 3–2 victory over [[Merseyside]] rivals Everton. They lost the League title, however, to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] with practically the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|last kick of the season]]. Ablett was now firmly established as the club's regular left back, missing just three league games that season.

Ablett flitted in and out of the squad over the next year, relegated in the pecking order following the arrival of [[Glenn Hysen]] and the progress of [[Steve Staunton]] and [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]]. He was used more frequently as a central defender rather than left full-back after Hansen began suffering more with injuries. Eventually, he took the central role more often following the arrival of left back [[David Burrows (footballer)|David Burrows]] from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and won the League again with Liverpool in 1990.

===Everton===
Kenny Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager on 22 February 1991, and his successor, [[Graeme Souness]], decided to sell Ablett for [[Pound (currency)|£]]750,000 to Everton in January 1992, after 147 appearances for the Reds. Ironically, his departure came at a time when he was getting more first team opportunities than he had done since the 1988–89 season.

He made his league debut for ''the Toffees'' on 19 January 1992 in a 1–1 draw with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] at [[Goodison Park]].

Ablett won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995, becoming the only player to win the competition with both Merseyside teams. However, he lost his first team place to [[Andy Hinchcliffe]] in the [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96 season]].

===Later career===
Ablett went on to make 128 league appearances and score five goals for Everton, and later went on to have a brief loan spell with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] before making a permanent move to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for £390,000, joining them at the same time as established Premiership players [[Steve Bruce]] and [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]], as new manager [[Trevor Francis]] set about building a side capable of challenging for a place in the Premier League. 

In three years with the Blues, he scored twice, with goals against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in the league<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.swindon-town-fc.co.uk/MatchCentre.asp?MatchID=19970134|title=Swindon Town 3 – 1 Birmingham City|publisher=Swindon Town FC.co.uk|date=26 February 1997|accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> and Leeds United in the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-fa-cup--history-and-hasselbaink-favour-graham-once-again-1145087.html|title= FA Cup – History and Hasselbaink favour Graham once again|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=16 February 1998|accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref>

He was released by Birmingham City manager [[Trevor Francis]] in 1999, and after short spells with [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] (playing under former Anfield team-mate [[Steve McMahon (footballer)|Steve McMahon]], scoring once against Luton Town)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://skysports.stats.football365.com/cgi-bin/results.pl?lang=english&year=2000&month=01&date=15|title=Fixtures & Results – Saturday, 15 January 2000|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=15 January 2000|accessdate=22 December 2010}}</ref> and [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], he signed for [[A-League (American)|American A-League]] side [[Long Island Rough Riders]] in June 2000. In February 2002, at the age of 36, Ablett was taken on trial by [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].

In 2006, Ablett appeared as a substitute in Replay 86, a charity match staged in aid of The Marina Dalglish Appeal, which pitted the Liverpool and Everton sides that had contested the [[1986 FA Cup Final]] against each other one more. Ablett's inclusion was curious, because although on Liverpool's books at the time of the Final, he did not actually make his debut for the club until the December of that year. Regardless, his contribution ensured Liverpool won the game 1–0.

==Coaching and managerial career==
In the summer of 2002, Ablett moved into coaching, taking up a post as the coach of Everton's under-17 side. He worked as part of the club's youth academy for several years until the summer of 2006, when he returned to his first club, taking the vacant job of [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves]] team coach, replacing [[Paco Herrera]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch now: Ablett's first interview|work=liverpoolfc.com|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/watch-now-ablett-s-first-lfc-interview|accessdate=28 September 2014 }}</ref> The same career opportunities were not available at Everton with [[Andy Holden]] firmly established as reserve-team manager.

In April 2008, under Ablett's guidance, Liverpool's reserves were crowned champions of the Premier Reserve League North, and the following month they became national champions after a play-off final victory against Aston Villa's reserves. In July 2008 he completed his final [[UEFA]] coaching qualification by obtaining the [[UEFA Pro License]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ablett gains final UEFA licence|work=liverpoolfc.tv|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/ablett-gains-final-uefa-licence|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

Ablett's son, Fraser (born 1991), signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] and has since played for [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]] since the demise of Chester City. He currently plays for [[Widnes Vikings F.C.|Widnes Vikings FC]] in the North West Counties Football League Division 1. 

On 28 May 2009, Liverpool announced that Ablett would be leaving his position as reserve team manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8072343.stm|title= Liverpool and Ablett part company|date=28 May 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref> On 8 July 2009 Ablett was announced as the new [[Stockport County]] manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/8140162.stm|title=Stockport confirm Ablett as boss|date=8 July 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> The club was in administration for the whole of the 2009–10 season, during which his team managed only five league wins. The club also went on a record consecutive losing run of games. He left the club on 17 June 2010 when the 2015 Group took ownership of the club.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1287334/Jim-Gannon-tipped-Stockport-return-Gary-Ablett-quits-managers-post-Edgeley-Park.html|title=Jim Gannon tipped for Stockport return as Gary Ablett quits manager's post at Edgeley Park|publisher=''Daily Mail''|date=17 June 2010|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>

'''Milenko Aćimović''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Миленко Аћимовић}}; born 15 February 1977 in [[Ljubljana]]) is a former [[Slovenia]]n [[association football|footballer]] who last played for Austria giants [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. He was a playmaker who has a great passing range and an abundance of skill. On 15 September 2010, Ačimovič ended his football career following a persistent right knee injury.

==Club career==
Born in Ljubljana, in present day Slovenia to Serbian parents, young Milenko started his career in the youth ranks of [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911–2004)|Olimpija Ljubljana]]. As an extremely gifted youngster, he made three first-team appearances for [[NK Ljubljana|Zeleznicar]] when he was just 17 years old. From 1996 until 1998 he found himself again playing for Olimpija, scoring 7 goals in 34 matches. He then joined [[Red Star Belgrade]].

Milenko played in [[Belgrade]] for four and a half years. He developed into quite a dependable midfielder. After successful appearances for [[Slovenia]]n national team in [[Euro 2000]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2002]], many bigger European clubs expressed interest in him. In the summer of 2002, he joined [[Tottenham Hotspur]]. In his first season in [[London]], he made a few appearances, but never established himself as a first team player. In his second season, he became a fringe player.

In January 2004 he joined the French club [[Lille OSC|Lille]] on loan until the end of the season. When he arrived, the club was in 14th place in the Ligue 1, but after some good form and fine performances by Acimovic they finished the season as runners up and therefore qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. In the first year they also played in the [[UEFA Cup]] and were eliminated in the last 16. They played in the third qualifying round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], and reached the group stages. Mile was Lille's creative spark and scored against [[Manchester United]] when Lille won the game in Paris 1–0. That was Lille's only goal of the campaign.

After playing for Lille in [[France]] for 2½ seasons he fell out of favor and surprisingly joined [[Ittihad FC|Al-Ittihad]] for the 2006–07 season. After failing to adapt to life in Saudi Arabia, he agreed on a mutual termination of the contract, subsequently moving back to Europe to join [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. On 15 September 2010, [[Austria Vienna]] midfielder Milenko Acimovic ended his football career following a persistent right knee injury.

Ačimović returned to [[Slovenia]] and has been appointed the Director of football at [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (2005)|Olimpija Ljubljana]], in January 2011, where he has stayed until September 2012 when he resigned his position, due to poor results of the team in the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]].

==International career==
He debuted for the [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia national team]] on 22 April 1998 in [[Murska Sobota]] against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. He gave many notable performances for the national team, including a spectacular goal scored from the middle of the field against Ukraine in the Euro 2000 play-off. He represented Slovenia at both [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2002]], scoring in their 1–3 defeat to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in [[Seogwipo]]. His final appearance for the national side came on 28 March 2007 in [[Celje]], during a 1–0 home defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in a [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying#Group G|Euro 2008 qualification]] match. He announced his retirement from international football that August.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ačimovič bids Slovenia adieu | url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=573109.html | work=UEFA.com | publisher=Union of European Football Associations | date=20 August 2007 | accessdate=12 July 2012 }}</ref>

'''Clárence Williams Acuña Donoso''' (born February 8, 1975 in [[Rancagua]]) is a [[Chile]]an former professional [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He played as a midfielder. 

== Chilean League ==
He started his career at [[Chile]]an club [[C.D. O'Higgins|O'Higgins]], whom he began playing for in 1994 at the age of nineteen. He played at O'Higgins until 1996, scoring eight goals in eighty-one games. 

He then caught the eye of professional club [[C.F. Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]. They signed him, and he played ninety games for them between 1997 and 1999, again scoring eight goals. His performances in the ''Copa Banco Estado'' attracted the attention of the [[Chile national football team|national team]] and he was given his first international cap in 1995.

== International ==
Acuña managed to keep up his good form and was included in the [[Chile national football team|Chile]] [[1998 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] squad for the 1998 event held in [[France]]. Here, he impressed players and pundits alike and helped his country to the last 16 stage of the tournament, where they bowed out in a 4-1 defeat to favourites [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. 

Despite this, Acuña was seen as one of the breakthrough players of the tournament and he also had his first experience of playing in [[Europe]], which would prove not to be his last.

A year later he was involved in another international tournament. This time his services were required in the [[Copa América 1999|Copa América]]. He started four games as Chile reached the semi-finals but were knocked out 5-3 on penalties against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] after a 1-1 draw. They also lost the third place playoff 2-1 against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] four days later.

== Newcastle United ==

After impressive domestic and international performances, Acuña was attracting attention from many big clubs, although he eventually signed for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], after manager [[Bobby Robson]] beat off competition from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] to clinch Acuña's signature, earning him a £900,000 move to Newcastle United in October 2000, after receiving a work permit. 

He made his debut for Newcastle on Saturday 28 October 2000 in a 1-0 away defeat to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. Two months later he scored his first goal for the club and the winner in the 2-1 victory against [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. The goal was later voted "Goal of the Week" by the [[BBC]]. He was at Newcastle for four seasons, playing forty-six league games (including eleven as substitute), scoring six times.

'''Charles Graham''' "'''Charlie'''" '''Adam''' (born 10 December 1985) is a Scottish [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]].

Adam was part of the [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] youth set up between 1999 and 2003<ref name=youth>{{cite web|url=http://www.youthfootballscotland.co.uk/news-a-media/my-youth-career/1304-charlie-adam|title=Charlie Adam|accessdate=22 February 2011|publisher=Youth Football Scotland}}</ref> before signing a youth contract with [[Alex McLeish]]'s [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] when he turned 17<ref name=youth/> and spent much of his early senior career on loan to other clubs. While on loan to [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] during season 2005–06, Adam was part of the team that won both the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] and [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], playing in over thirty matches for the "Saints". Upon returning to Rangers at the end of the 2006 season, he became a regular under managers [[Paul Le Guen]] and [[Walter Smith]]. Adam was also part of the Rangers team that reached the [[2008 UEFA Cup Final]].

After falling out of favour at Rangers during season 2008–09, Adam was loaned out to English [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. The loan was made permanent at the start of the 2009–10 season, and Adam became an integral part of the Blackpool side, captaining the team to a [[2009–10 in English football|play off victory]] over [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] which resulted in their promotion to the [[Premier League]]. Adam shone in his first season in the English Premier League, his performances being recognised with a nomination for the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in April 2011. However, Blackpool were relegated and consequently he transferred to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in July 2011. After one season at [[Anfield]] Adam joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in August 2012 for a fee of £4 million.

He has played at [[Scotland national under-21 football team|under-21]], [[Scotland B national football team|B]] and [[Scotland national football team|full international]] levels for Scotland.

They found that Blackpool were required to pay the player £25,000 for successfully avoiding relegation to League One. The club had argued that the promotion bonus (which had been stipulated in Adam's contract) superseded the 'survival bonus.' The panel upheld Adam's complaint, but did not agree with his second argument that the failure to pay the amount constituted a breach of contract on the club's part. As a result, both parties were responsible for their own legal fees – leaving Adam with a very small net gain from the venture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/12/08/adam-emerges-little-richer-from-legal-action-on-principle-against-miserly-blackpool-081205/|title=Adam emerges little richer from legal action ‘on principle’ against miserly Blackpool|first=|date=8 December 2010|publisher=Sporting Intelligence|accessdate=8 December 2010|location=London}}</ref>

'''Michael Richard''' "'''Micky'''" '''Adams''' (born 8 November 1961) is an [[English people|English]] former professional [[association football|footballer]] turned football manager who is in charge of [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]]. As a player he was a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full back]], and made a total of 438 league appearances in a nineteen-year professional career in [[the Football League]], including five years with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at the highest level. He began his managerial career as player-manager for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1994 and has led several teams at varying levels with mixed success, being named Manager of the Season twice, sacked a number of times and earning four promotions for the teams he has managed.

Born in [[Sheffield]], Adams was part of the youth team at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from the age of twelve until released in 1977. He turned professional at the Third Division team [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 1979, where he  established himself in the first team, winning a move in 1983 to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] who were in the First Division. He spent four years at Coventry before being sold on to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1987. He was bought by Southampton for £250,000 in 1989, where he enjoyed five years of top-flight football. He was loaned out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1994, before he signed with Fulham later in the year. Appointed as Fulham's player-manager in March 1996, he led the club out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]], and was named as the Third Division Manager of the Season. Sacked by Fulham despite his success, he walked out on [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] after less than two weeks in charge, and instead took charge at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in November 1997. He was sacked after the club were relegated at the end of the season. At this point he ended his playing career.

He joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager, taking charge for one [[Premier League]] game in a caretaker capacity. He returned to management with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in April 1999. He led the club to the Third Division title in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]], winning the division's Manager of the Season award for a second time. He then moved to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] as an assistant, before finally being named as the club's manager in April 2002. He took the club to the Premier League as [[Football League First Division|First Division]] runners-up in [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]], though he tendered his resignation in October 2004, having failed to keep the club in the top-flight. He took charge at former club Coventry City in January 2005, though lost his job in January 2007 after failing to take the club out of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. He returned to Brighton in May 2008, though his second spell in charge would only last nine months. He was appointed as manager of Port Vale in June 2009, before he departed for Sheffield United in December 2010, with Vale heading for promotion out of League Two. He failed to prevent United being relegated into [[Football League One|League One]], and was sacked in May 2011; this enabled him to return to Port Vale as manager. Despite starting the season in administration, he led Vale to promotion into League One in 2012–13. He resigned as Vale manager in September 2014, and took charge at Tranmere Rovers the following month. He has been married twice and has four daughters and one son.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Adams was born in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], and was an associate schoolboy with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from the age of twelve,<ref name="su" /> where his boyhood idol was [[Tony Currie (footballer)|Tony Currie]].<ref name="cn" /> He was a favourite of manager [[Jimmy Sirrel]], though Adams was released from the youth set-up a few months after [[Harry Haslam (footballer)|Harry Haslam]] replaced Sirrel as manager in September 1977.<ref name="su">{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Adams-goes-roots-Blades-return/story-12577022-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Adams goes back to his roots with a Blades return|last=Shaw|first=Steve|date=11 August 2009|work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>

===Gillingham===
United's youth team coach John Shaw also left the club and became a coach at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], and so Adams then travelled 240&nbsp;miles out from home to join Gillingham as an apprentice in August 1978.<ref name="up close">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/leicester/content/articles/2004/08/19/micky_adams_in_depth_interview_feature.shtml|title=Micky Adams up close|date=19 August 2004|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> During his time as an apprentice he won four caps for the [[England national under-17 football team|England youth team]], and competed in a tournament in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref name="up close" /> He went on to sign as a professional at Gillingham in November 1979. Due to his natural pace, Adams started his playing career as a [[Outside forward|left-winger]] before being converted into a left-back after he was found to lack the technical skill necessary to beat opponents.<ref name = "ITN">{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last= Holley |first= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-9534474-3-5|page=472}}</ref> Coming through the club's ranks at the same time as [[Steve Bruce]], Adams later cited [[Bill Collins (footballer)|Buster Collins]] as a major influence upon his career.<ref name="Buster">{{cite web| title = Adams and Bruce were Buster's premier pupils | publisher = Daily Telegraph| accessdate =27 September 2007 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/03/07/sfnpb207.xml|date=6 March 2004|first=Patrick |last=Barclay |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071118132027/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2004/03/07/sfnpb207.xml|archivedate = 18 November 2007}}</ref> In [[1982–83 Football League|1982–83]] he was named in the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]]'s Third Division [[PFA Team of the Year|Team of the Year]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lynch | title = The Official P.F.A.

===Coventry City and Leeds United===
After 103 appearances for [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Gillingham he moved on to top-flight [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 1983 for a fee approaching £85,000.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger|last= Triggs | title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club| publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd | year=2001| isbn=978-0-7524-2243-5|page=38}}</ref> He struggled with injury during his time at [[Highfield Road]], and was never popular with the fans.<ref name="up close" /> [[Keith Houchen]] also recalled that he did not get along with manager [[John Sillett]] and was prone to sulking when left out of the team.<ref>Strange, Jonathan. ''A Tenner and Box of Kippers: The Story of Keith Houchen'' p. 104 (Stadia, 2006, ISBN 978-0-7524-3796-5)</ref> Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Billy Bremner]] took him to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's [[FA Cup semi-finals|FA Cup Semi-final]] defeat to former club Coventry at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], as Coventry won 3–2 in extra time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/OnThisWeek/0,,10269~1030058,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120515214638/http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/OnThisWeek/0,,10269~1030058,00.html |archivedate=15 May 2012 |title=Hillsborough History |publisher= ''ccfc.co.uk.''|date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the [[1987 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off Final]] to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], again after extra time.

===Southampton===
His return to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] football came in March 1989 when [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] offered Leeds £250,000 for his services.<ref name="Sentinel">{{cite web |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Micky-Adams-career-far/story-12582327-detail/story.html|title=Micky Adams career so far|date=4 June 2009 |work=The Sentinel|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> Adams made his debut for the "Saints" on 25 March 1989, taking [[Derek Statham]]'s place at left-back in a 3–1 defeat by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Adams retained his place for the next seven games, before losing out to [[Gerry Forrest]] for the last few matches of the season.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=206}}</ref> Adams played the first seven matches of [[1989–90 in English football|the 1989–90 season]] before losing his place through injury to [[Francis Benali]], who then began to form a useful full-back partnership with [[Jason Dodd]]. In April 1990, Adams was recalled alongside new signing [[Oleksiy Cherednyk]] and they played out the remainder of the season together.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=213}}</ref>

Adams began to establish himself as the first-choice left-back at the start of [[1990–91 in English football|the 1990–91 season]], partnered first by Cherednyk and then Dodd, and finally by [[Barry Horne (footballer)|Barry Horne]] on the right.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=219}}</ref> Once he had overcome the niggling injuries of his first two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]], Adams' consistency began to ensure that the left-back position was more or less his own, with his energetic forays along the touchline helping to give the side an extra cutting edge.<ref name = "ITN"/> His first goals for the Saints came in [[1991–92 in English football|the 1991–92 season]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=223}}</ref> Against West Ham on 14 April 1992, he scored the only goal with a far-post volley in the 88th minute after [[Matthew Le Tissier]] had created space to whip over a cross: the goal was described as "a moment of true class in an otherwise ordinary game".<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=222}}</ref>

During [[1992–93 Southampton F.C. season|the inaugural season]] of the [[Premier League]], Adams missed only four games, making 38 appearances with four goals, with his right-wing partner now being [[Jeff Kenna]], with manager [[Ian Branfoot]] playing Dodd and Benali further forward.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=228}}</ref> He wrote himself into the history books, for all the wrong reasons, when he was sent off for dissent on 19 August 1992 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at [[Loftus Road]], during the second game of the season.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=224}}</ref> His was the first ever red card in the Premiership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orange.co.uk/sport/football/6057_pr.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120226045732/http://www.orange.co.uk/sport/football/6057_pr.htm |archivedate=26 February 2012 |title=Ask the Gaffer football trivia archive |publisher= ''orange.co.uk'' |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> The [[1993–94 Southampton F.C. season|1993–94]] Premiership season was Adams' last in the top flight; he started the season as the preferred choice at left-back before losing out to [[Simon Charlton]]. He featured in 19 out of 42 league games that season as Southampton finished 18th and narrowly avoided relegation. His final game for Southampton came in a 1–0 defeat at home to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], immediately following which Branfoot was sacked as manager, to be replaced by [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=235}}</ref> Adams never played under Ball and was loaned out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in March 1994 until the end of the season.<ref name = "ITN"/> He scored three goals in ten games for the "Potters", but did not join the club on a permanent basis as the management staff refused to allow him to help out as a coach at the club's academy.<ref name="up close" /> In his five years with Southampton, Adams made a total of 174 first-team appearances, scoring seven goals.<ref name = "ITN"/>

===Fulham===
In July 1994, he joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a free transfer where he was reunited with Ian Branfoot in preparation for the "Cottagers" [[1994–95 Fulham F.C. season|1994–95 season]]. Fulham had just been relegated to Division Three (the bottom tier of the professional league) for the first time in their history. He signed with the club on the understanding that Branfoot would teach him the ropes of coaching.<ref name="up close" /> They finished seventh in the league that season, but due to a restructuring of the league which saw one less promotion place in the three lower divisions, Fulham missed out on a play-off place. When Branfoot became general manager in March 1996, Adams was appointed player-manager of a Fulham side on course for their lowest ever finish – 17th in Division Three.

==Managerial career==
Before going into management, the "straight-talking [[Yorkshire]]man"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/lmatv/interview-3786.html|title=Adams aims to upset the odds|date=21 July 2003|work=[[League Managers Association|LMA]] |accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> had already demonstrated his ability to spot talented youngsters. Around 1994, he spotted [[Wayne Bridge]] playing for Olivers Battery; he recommended Bridge to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who then signed him as a trainee in July 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Port-Vale-Fresh-start-players-says-Adams/story-12510695-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Fresh start for players, says Adams|last=Shaw|first=Steve|date=9 June 2009|work=The Sentinel |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>

===Fulham===
Adams moved into management with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], taking over from [[Ian Branfoot]] in March 1996 with the London club languishing in 91st place in the league pyramid.<ref name="up close" /><ref>{{cite web

Following [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]'s takeover of Fulham, Adams was dismissed as manager in September 1997 in favour of the higher profile combination of [[Kevin Keegan]] (director of football) and [[Ray Wilkins]] (head coach).<ref name="fulhammilestones">{{cite news

{{quote|"I have to say that it was probably the right decision because look where they are now. All Mr Fayed has to say is 'there's my record'. At the time getting rid of me was a harsh decision.

===Swansea to Brentford to Nottingham===
Shortly after his dismissal from Fulham, Adams made a quick return to management with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in Division Three, but left after thirteen days and three matches in charge. Adams claimed that the money he had been promised to strengthen the team had not been forthcoming.<ref>{{cite news

Before 1997 was out, Adams took his third job of the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]] when he was named manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. The club had suffered a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two [[1997 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off final]], and were struggling near the foot of the table. He signed striker [[Andy Scott (English footballer)|Andy Scott]] from [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a fee of £75,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Port-Vale-Scott-ready-lock-horns-boss/story-13438795-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Scott ready to lock horns with former boss|date=30 September 2011|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to Division Three on the last day of the season, and the club was bought out by [[Ron Noades]], who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.<ref name="CT" />

After taking a break from the game, Adams joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager under [[Dave Bassett]]. Bassett was dismissed in January 1999 and so Adams took charge as [[caretaker manager]] for a single [[Premier League|Premiership]] match, before [[Ron Atkinson]] was appointed as Bassett's replacement.<ref>{{cite news

===Brighton===
Adams returned to management in April 1999 with Division Three team [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. The club were in the middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the [[Goldstone Ground]] just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-312.html|title=High flying Seagulls delight Adams |date=15 March 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker [[Bobby Zamora]]. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-547.html|title= Micky Adams is named Division Three winner |date=22 May 2001 |work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

In his second season as manager, [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]], Adams guided Brighton to promotion as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league's basement division. A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-355.html|title= Adams hoping to catch Chesterfield |date=23 March 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-467.html|title= Micky and Nicky promoted |date=2 May 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> leaving Brighton ten points clear at the season's end. He was named as Third Division Manager of the season for a second time, also picking up the [[Football League Third Division Manager of the Month|Third Division Manager of the Month]] award in September 2000.

Adams was clear about his ambitions at managing at a higher level, stating his disappointment at not being offered the management positions at either [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] or [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the summer of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-711.html|title=Adams sad to miss Premier interviews|date=16 July 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> He did leave "Seagulls" in October 2001, though by then he had already set the foundations for Brighton to achieve a second successive promotion as Division Two champions in [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]]. Over the summer he had brought in players such as [[Simon Morgan]], [[Geoff Pitcher]], [[Robbie Pethick]] and [[Dirk Lehmann]], to give Brighton depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-1002.html|title=Selfless squad suits Seagulls|date=20 September 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

===Coventry City===
In January 2005, Adams made a return to management in the Championship with struggling [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], a club he had been at during his playing career.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Adams named as Coventry manager| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/4193941.stm| publisher= BBC Sport| date= 21 January 2005| accessdate=22 July 2007}}</ref> Adams managed to save the club from relegation by the end of [[2004–05 in English football|the season]], winning the [[Football League Championship Manager of the Month]] award for April in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-4955.html|title=Adams wins two awards in the week |date=6 May 2005 |work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

He was expected by some to mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in [[2005–06 Coventry City F.C. season|2005–06]], which was the club's first season in the new [[Ricoh Arena]]. The team started out poorly, but improved in the second half of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in [[Dennis Wise]].<ref name="CT" /> However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.

He spent £300,000 on midfielder [[Chris Birchall]] for the start of the [[2006–07 Coventry City F.C. season|2006–07]] season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coventry bring in Vale's Birchall|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/5249340.stm|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=5 August 2006}}</ref> His team started well, however mid-way through the campaign, following a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form.

This culminated in a 2–0 home defeat to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in the [[FA Cup]], a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship.<ref name="CT">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/factfile-micky-adams-3117362|title=Factfile: Micky Adams|last=Smith|first=Martin|date=17 January 2007|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Adams sacked as Coventry manager| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/6270295.stm| publisher= BBC Sport| date= 17 January 2007| accessdate=22 July 2007}}</ref> He admitted that the sale of [[Gary McSheffrey]] to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that "I genuinely believe that I could have turned it around" and "I tried my best and that's all I can do."<ref name="could have">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Adams%3A+I+could%27ve+turned+it+around%3B+%2B%2B%2B+MICKY+ADAMS+SACKING.-a0157846197|title=Adams: I could've turned it around|last=Turner|first=Andy|date=18 January 2007|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training,<ref>{{cite news|title=Daniel Jones sacked over Doug Loft 'facial injury'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27021805|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 April 2014}}</ref> and had to deal with months of speculation over his own future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract.<ref>{{cite news|title=Port Vale: Micky Adams needs to take his time - Mark Grew|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27408470|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> He signed the contract the following month.<ref>{{cite news|title=Micky Adams: Port Vale manager signs new rolling contract|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27766994|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=9 June 2014}}</ref>

After eleven players left the club in 2014, Adams rebuilt for the [[2014–15 Port Vale F.C. season|2014–15]] campaign by signing left-sided player [[Colin Daniel]], Northern Ireland internationals [[Ryan McGivern]] and [[Michael O'Connor (footballer, born 1987)|Michael O'Connor]], pacey winger [[Mark Marshall]], Crewe Alexandra attacker [[Byron Moore]], veteran midfielder [[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]], and midfielder [[Steve Jennings (footballer)|Steve Jennings]], and also took in three loanees in Swiss full-back [[Freddie Veseli]], highly rated striker [[Jordan Slew]] and French target man [[Achille Campion]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Port Vale sign Colin Daniel from League Two Mansfield|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27681617|accessdate=3 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=3 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=mcgiv>{{cite news|title=Ryan McGivern: Port Vale sign Hibernian defender|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28093952|accessdate=30 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=30 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mark Marshall: Port Vale sign Coventry City winger|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28095935|accessdate=2 July 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Byron Moore: Port Vale bring in winger from rivals Crewe|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28152722|accessdate=3 July 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Michael Brown, Steve Jennings & Michael O'Connor join Port Vale|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28376399|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ipswich defender Frederic Veseli signs on loan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28544293|accessdate=2 August 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=29 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Blackburn Rovers loan striker to Port Vale|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28981641|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=29 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Port Vale sign Frenchman Achille Campion|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29015306|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 September 2014}}</ref> Defeat to local rivals [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not turn around quickly.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baggaley|first1=Mike|title=Port Vale boss Micky Adams says he is fighting to save his job |url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Port-Vale-boss-Micky-Adams-says-fighting-save-job/story-22921127-detail/story.html|accessdate=14 September 2014|work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]|date=13 September 2014}}</ref> Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman.<ref>{{cite news|title=Micky Adams: Port Vale manager steps down for a second time|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29253698|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 September 2014}}</ref>

'''Neil James Adams''' (born 23 November 1965) is a former professional [[Association football|football]]er and former manager of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. He played for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and Norwich City.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City">{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City|year=1994|publisher=Lion Press|isbn=0-9524151-0-0}}</ref>

Adams began his career playing for his local club Stoke City, where he earned a reputation of being a promising winger. This prompted Everton to pay a fee of £150,000 for his signature in June 1986. Injuries prevented him from reaching his potential at [[Goodison Park]] and after three years he moved on to Oldham Athletic. At Oldham, Adams played a major role in helping the club gain promotion to the newly formed [[Premier League]] in 1992 and also helped the Latics to reach the [[1990 Football League Cup Final|1990 League Cup Final]]. He signed for Norwich City in February 1994 for a fee of £250,000. He became a regular in the Norwich for the next six seasons before ending his playing career with another two years at Oldham. After retiring from playing, Adams became a pundit for [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], before taking up a coaching role at the Norwich City Academy – guiding them to victory in the [[2012–13 FA Youth Cup]]. In April 2014 Adams was appointed first-team manager following the departure of [[Chris Hughton]].

Adams was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and began his career with local side [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] making his professional debut against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in the [[Full Members Cup]] in [[1985–86 Stoke City F.C. season|1985–86]].<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/> He made a huge impression with his performances for Stoke in his debut season, with his attacking creativity and deadly accurate crossing ability earning him a call up to the [[England under-21 national football team|England U21]] side for their European Championship semi-final tie in Italy.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/> With Stoke's finances poor and many top-flight sides showing an interest in signing him, he was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in June 1986 for a fee of £150,000 after the Toffees beat off competition from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, much to the annoyance to the Stoke supporters who feared that their club was becoming a 'selling club'.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Stoke City"/>

In his first season at Everton he helped the side win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title in [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]]. During his three years on Merseyside he also won two Charity Shield medals and earned his first England U-21 cap in an away game against Sweden. In June 1989 he rejected the offer of a new contract at Goodison Park and joined [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in a £100,000 deal. The five seasons that Adams spent at [[Boundary Park]] was to coincide with the club's golden period. In 1990 he played for the Latics in the League Cup Final against Nottingham Forest, and the following season he helped the team win the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title as Oldham won promotion to the newly formed [[Premier League]].

Adams' contribution from the right flank helped Oldham establish themselves against the best sides in the country, and he was influential in helping the Latics maintain their top-flight status during their 1992–93 campaign by scoring 9 goals – including crucial strikes against Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea and most memorably the only goal in a 1–0 defeat of soon-to-be-crowned double winners, Manchester United.

Whilst at Oldham he also picked up a Carling No. 1 Award – selected by a Premiership committee before the start of the 1993–94 season. In early 1994 [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] made inquiries about acquiring his services, and after protracted negotiations between the two clubs he eventually signed for the Canaries for a fee of £250,000 in mid-February. Adams was to become a regular in the Norwich side during his time at [[Carrow Road]]. He assumed the role of penalty taker and dead ball specialist for the Canaries, and in his career he only missed from the spot once, in a league cup game against Swansea.

He started in all but one of Norwich's games during the 1996–97 campaign, and completed that season as the Canaries' second top-scorer with a total of 16 goals. In 2002, Norwich fans voted Adams into the [[Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame]]. After leaving Norfolk in the summer of 1999, Adams returned to former club Oldham for two seasons before a knee injury forced him to retire.

==Managerial career==
A holder of the UEFA 'A' Coaching Licence, he returned to Norwich where was appointed as manager of the club's U-18s. Adams guided the side to victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2012–13 FA Youth Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FA Youth Cup final: Norwich beat Chelsea 4–2 on aggregate|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22519280|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> On 6 April 2014 he was appointed Norwich City first-team caretaker manager following the departure of [[Chris Hughton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ADAMS REPLACES HUGHTON AS BOSS|url=http://www.canaries.co.uk/news/article/20140406-adams-hughton-norwich-city-manager-1471649.aspx|work=Norwich City F.C|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> On 22 May 2014 he was appointed permanent manager of Norwich City, signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Adams: Norwich City hand caretaker boss permanent job|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27530377|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> Adams resigned from his position on 5 January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Adams resigns as Norwich City manager|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30685075|website=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

'''Tony Alexander Adams''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 10 October 1966) is an English [[Association football|football]] manager and former Arsenal player.

Adams spent his [[One club man|entire playing career]] of 22 years as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref name="testimonial">{{cite news

With Arsenal, he won four top flight division titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, two [[Football League Cup]]s, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], and three [[FA Community Shield]]s. A statue honouring Adams was unveiled at Emirates stadium on 9 December 2011, along with statues of [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Herbert Chapman]].

When his playing career finished Adams went into football management, spending periods in charge of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Azerbaijan]] side [[Gabala FK|Gabala]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Romford]], Adams grew up in [[Dagenham]] and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then [[Eastbrook Comprehensive School]] from 1978 to 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet52FootballpersonalitiesofBD.pdf|title=Football personalities of Barking and Dagenham|publisher=London Borough of Barking & Dagengham|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>

==Club career==
Adams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980. He made his first team debut on 5 November 1983 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], four weeks after his 17th birthday. Adams became a regular player in the [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86 season]], winning his first major trophy in 1987 when playing in the [[Football League Cup]] Final win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].

Together with [[Lee Dixon]], [[Nigel Winterburn]] and [[Steve Bould]], Adams was part of the "famous four" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the [[Offside law (football)|offside trap]]. On 1 January 1988, he became Arsenal captain at the age of 21;<ref name="greatest">{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-no-3.-tony-adams|title=Gunners' Greatest Players – 3. Tony Adams|
author=Arsenal.com|work=Official Arsenal Website|date=5–19 May 2008|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> he would remain club captain for the next 14 years until his retirement.

Adams's strong discipline of the defence was considered a factor in Arsenal winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87]] and then the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship twice; the first in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] after a [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|win]] over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the final game of the season; the second in [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]], losing once all season.

In [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] Adams gained the distinction of being the captain of the first English side to win the League Cup and [[FA Cup]] double, lifting the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] the following year.

Despite this success, a battle with [[alcoholism]], which started in the mid-1980s, increasingly blighted his life as he was reportedly often involved in fights in [[nightclub]]s. On 6 May 1990, Adams crashed his [[Ford Sierra]] into a wall in [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]] and when breathalysed his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal drink-drive limit. On 19 December that year, at [[Southend]] [[Crown Court]],<ref name="greatest" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/sports/top-10-stupid-criminal-acts-by-footballers_4.html|title=Tony Adams|publisher=Ask Men|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=519627|title=Stick Your Two Points Up Your Arsenal|first=Tim|last=Stillman|publisher=Vital Football|date=25 July 2010|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref> he was imprisoned for four months (being freed after half of his sentence on 15 February 1991) but after being released, his alcoholism continued and he was involved in further alcohol-related incidents, including playing through a match during the [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94 season]] despite being drunk, falling down stairs and needing 29 stitches to a head wound when drunk, and letting off fire extinguishers and firing a flare gun into a disabled lavatory with team-mate [[Ray Parlour]] at [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Hornchurch]] where they were being taunted by supporters of rival clubs.

Finally, on 14 September 1996, Adams admitted to the public that he was an [[alcoholic]] and, after seeking treatment, found a more sensitive side to his character emerging, which included a return to education and an attempt to learn the [[piano]]. He became one of the most high-profile [[recovering alcoholic]]s in the UK;<ref name="ias">{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Publication-archive/Alcohol-Alert/Issue-3-1998/Adams-turns-his-back-on-alcohol.aspx|title=Adams turns his back on alcohol|author=Paul Whittaker|work=Alcohol Works|date=March 1998|accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> his battle with alcohol is detailed in his [[autobiography]], ''Addicted'', which was released in May 1998 to enormous critical acclaim.<ref name="ias"/>

[[File:Tony Adams Statue.jpg|thumb|200px|Tony Adams statue outside the [[Emirates Stadium]].]]His recovery and rehabilitation were helped in no small part by the arrival of [[Arsène Wenger]] as Arsenal manager in October 1996. Wenger reformed the club's [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] practices and the players' lifestyles. Wenger stuck by Adams following his confessions about his drink problem, and the improvements in the regime probably extended Adams's career by several years. Adams rewarded his manager's understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|Doubles]], in [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]] and [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]]; he is the only player in English football history to have captained a title-winning team in three different decades.

In August 2002, just before the start of the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the last league game of the season at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (the 2002 [[FA Cup Final]] was unusually played ''before'' the last league fixtures). He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only [[David O'Leary]] has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club's history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07 season]], when it was assigned to [[Philippe Senderos]], it currently is the squad number of French defender [[Laurent Koscielny]]

Just before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of [[Steve Coppell]], but his application was rejected.<ref>{{cite news

Nicknamed "Mr Arsenal", he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including [[Ian Wright]], [[John Lukic]] and Adams's fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1–1 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal.

In March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal [[BBC Sport]] named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2872203.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blast from the past: Part one | date=24 March 2003 | first=Tom | last=Fordyce}}</ref>

In 2004, Adams was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club's website.

A statue of Adams was placed outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary on 9 December 2011. Manager Herbert Chapman and Arsenal's all-time top goal scorer [[Thierry Henry]] and later [[Dennis Bergkamp]] were also immortalised with statues outside the ground.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2072146/Arsenal-statues-unveiled-Thierry-Henry-tears.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Teary Henry as Arsenal unveil statues to former French star, Adams and Chapman | date=10 December 2011}}</ref>

==International career==
Adams made his debut for [[England national football team|England]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in 1987, and played in [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 88]], scoring one of England's two goals. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.

After a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] squad by manager [[Bobby Robson]], and missed [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 92]] due to injury. However, he still maintained a regular place in defence, and after the retirement of [[Gary Lineker]] in 1992, Adams unofficially shared the captaincy of England with [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]], though Adams became England captain outright before [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]], as Platt's place in the side became less secure. England reached the semi-finals of Euro 96, before losing on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

When England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] took the Captain's armband from Adams and gave it to [[Alan Shearer]] it was a bitter pill for Adams to swallow. Speaking at a fans' forum in 2008 Adams remarked "I have some resentment over the way Glenn Hoddle gave the captaincy to Alan Shearer instead of me but I can let that go. I reacted positively. I disagreed with him [Hoddle] and he thought Alan could get more penalties being a centre forward. People know my reaction to that".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Adams continued to play for the national side, however and he finally appeared in a World Cup finals in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. His international swansong was England's largely unsuccessful [[2000 European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams's 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving [[Rio Ferdinand]], Adams retired from international football before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England's second goal in a 2–0 friendly win over Ukraine on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against Saudi Arabia in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.

Adams was the first, and remains to date the only, England player to make tournament appearances in three separate decades.

==Managerial and coaching career==
After starting a [[sports science]] degree at [[Brunel University]], Adams became the manager of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in November 2003. He was unable to prevent the club's relegation to [[Football League Two|League Two]] that season, and although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/3995677.stm | title=Adams resigns as Wycombe manager | work=BBC Sport | date=9 November 2004 | accessdate=25 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He resigned from Wycombe in November 2004, citing personal reasons. He was succeeded by [[John Gorman (footballer)|John Gorman]].

In July 2005, Adams accepted a trainee coaching role with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] side [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] with special responsibility for its Jong team, which is a reserve/junior side. Adams later had a short spell seconded to [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] as a first team trainee coach in January and February 2006. While at Feyenoord he also worked part-time as a scout for Arsenal, watching games in Italy, France, and the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.setanta.com/US/Articles/Football/2009/06/03/Exclusive-Adams-on-Arsenal-interest/gnid-55518/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090607082940/http://www.setanta.com/US/Articles/Football/2009/06/03/Exclusive-Adams-on-Arsenal-interest/gnid-55518/|archivedate=7 June 2009|title=Exclusive: Italian job for Gunners|first=Chris|last=Stanton|publisher=Setanta|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>

Adams joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] as assistant manager to [[Harry Redknapp]] in June 2006, a position left vacant by the departure of [[Kevin Bond (footballer)|Kevin Bond]]. In his first season as assistant, Portsmouth finished ninth in the [[Premier League]] – their highest standing since the 1950s and won the [[2007–08 FA Cup|2007–08]] [[FA Cup]].

==Charitable work==
In September 2000, as a result of his own experiences with [[alcoholism]] and [[drug addiction]], Adams founded the [[Sporting Chance Clinic]], a charitable foundation aimed at providing treatment, counselling and support for sports men and women suffering from drink, drug or [[gambling addiction]]s.<ref>

==Post-football career==
Adams remains a popular figure with Arsenal fans. In December 2008, more than six years after he left the club, Adams led out his Portsmouth side onto the pitch at Arsenal to be greeted with the chant "There's only one Tony Adams" by Arsenal fans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1102323/Arsenal-1-Portsmouth-0-Same-old-song-Tony-Adams-falls-short.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Arsenal 1 Portsmouth 0: Same old song as Adams falls short | first=Simon | last=Cass | date=29 December 2008}}</ref>

'''Miles Vivien Esifi Addison''' (born 7 January 1989) is an English [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] on loan from [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]]. He can play as both a central defender or a central midfielder.<ref name="Missedchance">{{cite web | title=Addison: I feared I'd missed my chance with the Rams| work=Derby Telegraph | url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Addison-feared-d-miss-chance-Rams/story-11617547-detail/story.html| accessdate=12 November 2013 }}</ref>

==Club career==

===Derby County===
Though born in London, Addison moved to [[Nottingham]] at the age of 3,<ref name="Missedchance"/> where he was spotted by scouts from the Derby County youth system. Addison was handed his first team debut by interim manager [[Terry Westley]], who he had worked closely with in the youth and reserve teams, towards the end of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] season, in the 1–1 [[Football League Championship|Championship]] draw with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] on 17 April 2006,<ref name="Missedchance"/> where he played in the centreback position alongside side another academy graduate [[Lewin Nyatanga]]. He kept his place for the following match, a 2–0 defeat away to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] 5 days later.

With the appointment of [[Billy Davies]] as Derby manager, Addison found himself frozen out of the first team at Derby and didn't appear in the starting eleven again until Davies' successor, [[Paul Jewell]], gave him a surprise start, again at centreback, in a 3–1 defeat away to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] in the penultimate game of the [[2007–08 Premier League]] season.<ref name="Missedchance"/>

Derby's poor start to the [[2008–09 Derby County F.C. season|2008–09]] season saw Addison given a chance to cement a place in the first team and he was given his first start of the campaign in the 1–0 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston]] on 26 August 2008. Starting in his preferred position of central midfield for the first time, Addison impressed enough to retain his place for the subsequent match away to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. This was the start of a run of 15 consecutive appearances in the first team, which was only ended when suspension for reaching five yellow cards ruled him out of the League Cup 4th round tie against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Addison formed a formidable midfield partnership with [[Paul Green (footballer born 1983)|Paul Green]] during this time as the Rams embarked on a run of only 2 defeats in 13 matches and moved from the bottom of the table to the fringes of the playoff places. Addison's form earned high praise from Jewell as an example to the club's other academy players<ref name="PJPleased">{{cite news | title=Jewell pleased with Addison effort| work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7596066.stm| accessdate=3 September 2008 | date=3 September 2008}}</ref> and saw him sign a new three-and-a-half year deal with the club on 2 September to keep him at the club until 2011.<ref name="Signsdeal">{{cite news | title=Addison signs new deal with Rams| work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7593285.stm| accessdate=2 September 2008 | date=2 September 2008}}</ref> November saw Addison linked with a £2 million move to [[Premier League]] [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]].<ref name="Stoke">{{cite news | title=Wednesday's gossip column| work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/7710088.stm| accessdate=5 November 2008 | date=5 November 2008}}</ref> However, Jewell denied this, saying "I spoke to Tony (Pulis, Stoke manager) about another matter and he never mentioned it.

Addison said "it was a dream to captain the side who I support". Addison was substituted during Derby's 4–1 win over [[Blackpool F.C.]], an injury which was later diagnosed to be a stress fracture of his foot, which ruled him out for the rest of the 2008–09 season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/7922879.stm | work=BBC News | title=Addison injury blow rocks Derby | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Despite missing the latter part of the campaign Addison's form was such that he won the [[Sammy Crooks]] Trophy – Derby County's Young Player of the Season award – for the 2008/09 season.

Addison had a great start to the 2009/10 season with goals against [[Peterborough United]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but a succession of foot problems restricted him to just five starts between October 2009 and February 2010 and he underwent specialist surgery in America.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11696/5953415/ | work=Sky Sports | title=Addison blow for Rams | date=16 February 2010}}</ref> The surgery was successful but he was ruled out for the remainder of Derby's 2009/10 season as well as the entirety of the 2010/11 campaign.<ref name="addisonfootop">{{cite web | title=Clough pleased with Addison op| publisher=Sky Sports| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11696/6053550/| date = 25 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name="outforseason">{{cite web | title=Addison facing long recovery| publisher=Sky Sports| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11696/6107606/| date = 21 April 2010 }}</ref> However, Addison made a quicker than expected recovery, with Clough suggesting he may be back in first team action as early as January 2011.

====Loan at Bournemouth====

===Arsenal===
On 13 January 2006, Arsenal signed Adebayor for a reported [[Pound sterling|£]]3m.

For the start of the 2010–11 season he was given the number 9 shirt instead of his favoured number 25 which he previously wore at Arsenal and City.

He gave me the chance to be where I am today and He’s the one that can take it all away from me. There is nothing more important for me than God." Adebayor could not walk for the first four years of his life. His mother took young Adebayor around Africa looking for a cure. Adebayor then spoke about his 'miracle' saying, "... I was in the church laying down and, around nine or ten o’clock on the Sunday morning, I could hear children playing outside. Suddenly somebody kicked a ball into the church. And the first person to stand up and run was me, because I wanted to get that ball."<ref>{{cite web|title=Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor's football 'miracle' taught him to walk|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/4444076/Arsenal-striker-Emmanuel-Adebayors-football-miracle-taught-him-to-walk.html}}</ref>

Agathe began his career at French side [[Montpellier HSC]] before moving to Scotland to join [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] and then [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. His performances gained him a high profile transfer to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] where he enjoyed the most successful spell of his career winning three championships and was part of the squad that reached the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]].

== Career ==

===Early career===
Agathe began his career in [[Ligue 1|France]] with [[Montpellier HSC]] and also had a loan spell with [[Olympique Alès]].

===Raith Rovers===
He moved to [[Scotland]] in 1999, playing for a year with [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]]. At this time he was playing as a [[forward (association football)|striker]]. His goals alerted [[Scottish Premier League|Premier League]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], who signed him on a short-term contract in the summer of 2000.

===Hibernian===
Agathe scored four goals in five [[Scottish Premier League]] games for Hibs, who also used him as a [[forward (association football)|striker]].

===Celtic===
This form and his short contract led to Celtic stepping in to sign Agathe for just [[Pound sterling|£]]35,000. [[Martin O'Neill]] used Agathe as either a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|right back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|right wingback]] and was a regular in his side. The club won three championships and reached the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]].<ref name = "academy"/> Following good performances in European competition he was once linked with moves to [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] during the 2001–02 season.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. In February 2004, the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] manager [[Berti Vogts]] expressed interest in selecting Agathe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/feb/02/match.sport14 |title=Dour debut for other De Boer |work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Clark |first=Graham |accessdate=14 August 2010 |date=2 February 2004}}</ref>

Agathe hardly featured during the [[2005-06 in Scottish football|2005–06 season]] under new manager [[Gordon Strachan]], and was [[free transfer (football)|released]] at the end of the season.

===Aston Villa===
Agathe underwent a trial at [[Premier League]] side [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] prior to the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07 season]]. He began training with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], managed by his former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] boss [[Martin O'Neill]], after his attempt at joining Blackburn was unsuccessful. He agreed a short term contract and made his Villa début at home to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1–1 draw. On 11 January 2007, however, Agathe parted company with Aston Villa, after they chose not to extend his short term contract.<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Agathe parts company with Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6253691.stm |work=BBC|date=11 January 2007|accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref> Agathe made a total of six substitute appearances in his short time at [[Villa Park (stadium)|Villa Park]], but did not start a single game.

===JS Saint-Pierroise===
He then signed for [[JS Saint-Pierroise]], a club in his homeland of [[Réunion]].

Agathe has set up an academy for young footballers on [[Réunion]].<ref name = "academy">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stirling_albion/8911389.stm |title=Three join Stirling Albion from Agathe's academy |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> Three players – Heeking Jerome, Mathis Yohan and Jeremy Judith – signed for [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] in August 2010.<ref name = "academy"/>

'''Gabriel Imuetinyan "Gabby" Agbonlahor''' (born 13 October 1986), is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]].

He is a product of [[Aston Villa F.C. Reserves and Academy|Aston Villa's Academy]], and made his first-team debut in 2006 following loans to [[The Football League|Football League]] clubs [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday]]. Since then, he has made 300 [[Premier League]] appearances for the club, scoring in ten consecutive seasons.  With 73 goals, he is Aston Villa's all-time leading [[Premier League]] goalscorer, having scored in ten consecutive league seasons.

Formerly a regular with [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]], Agbonlahor made his senior international debut in 2008 and earned three caps overall.

==Club career==
===2005–06 season===
Agbonlahor came through the youth ranks at local club Aston Villa. He signed a two-year professional contract at the club in June 2005.<ref name=watford>{{cite news|title=Watford seal Agbonlahor loan deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/4271784.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=22 September 2005}}</ref> On 22 September 2005, he was loaned to Championship club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]],<ref name=watford/> where he made his senior debut six days later, replacing [[Trevor Benjamin]] at half time in a 1&ndash;3 defeat away to [[Coventry City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Coventry 3-1 Watford|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4277762.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=28 September 2005}}</ref> He made his first start in his only other match for Watford, a goalless draw against [[Leeds United]] at [[Vicarage Road]] on 1 October, in which he made way for [[Francino Francis]] after 65 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watford 0-0 Leeds|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4277798.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=1 October 2005}}</ref> Agbonlahor was loaned to another team from the division on 28 October, [[Sheffield Wednesday]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Transfers - October 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/gossip_and_transfers/4305252.stm|accessdate=14 March 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=28 October 2005}}</ref> where he made eight appearances without scoring.

Agbonlahor's [[Premier League]] debut for Villa came on 18 March 2006 at the age of 19, under manager [[David O'Leary]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Goodison Park]]. O'Leary was forced to delve into the youth academy because of a lack of senior strikers due to injury, thus earning Agbonlahor a rare start. He scored after 63 minutes, although Villa went on to lose the match 4–1.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Everton 4–1 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4796520.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref>

===2006–07 season===
In five pre-season games of the [[2006–07 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006–07 season]], Agbonlahor netted three goals for Aston Villa; a quick double salvo against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] (the first a near-post header, the latter a close range finish) in a 5–0 victory,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Villa thrash Walsall in friendly |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/5205308.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref> and a consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat at [[NEC (football club)|NEC]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=NEC Nijmegen 2, Villa 1 |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-match-reports/2006/08/08/nec-nijmegen-2-villa-1-97319-17531850/ |newspaper=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref>

Agbonlahor started the season on the right wing in [[Martin O'Neill]]'s new-look Villa side, and would be part of the team that managed to get a point from the first Premiership game at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s new [[Emirates Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Arsenal 1–1 Aston Villa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4786655.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 August 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Simon | last=Austin }}</ref> Agbonlahor's first goal of the season came at home against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], in a 2–0 win.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Charlton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5351926.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=23 September 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Nathan |last=Mercer}}</ref> On 30 September, Agbonlahor scored a crucial equaliser against Premiership champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] just before half-time, heading in [[Liam Ridgewell]]'s cross with a glancing header to earn Villa a 1–1 draw.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Chelsea 1–1 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/5373472.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Caroline |last=Cheese }}</ref>

Agbonlahor also provided cup heroics in 2006, scoring an injury-time winner to beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 3–2 at the [[Walkers Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Leicester 2–3 Aston Villa (aet) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6072636.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 October 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref> The following game, he scored a consolation effort in Villa's first loss of the season, on 28 October, ten games in.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Liverpool 3–1 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6072868.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 October 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=John |last=Sinnott }}</ref>

Agbonlahor completed his run of scoring against the so-called "[[Premier league#"Big Four" dominance|Big Four]]", when he added [[Manchester United]] to a list of his victims. Aston Villa were beaten 3–1 in the game at [[Old Trafford]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Man Utd 3–1 Aston Villa|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6236709.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Phil |last=McNulty }}</ref> Agbonlahor then scored deep into injury time in the following game, against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] on 20 January, to end a Villa winless run that stretched back to 11 November.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Watford |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6258655.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera }}</ref>

Agbonlahor had played every minute of Aston Villa's campaign in 2006–07, until he was replaced by [[Patrik Berger]], in the 2–0 away fixture against [[Reading FC|Reading]], on 10 February 2007. The following match was the first of the season that Agbonlahor did not start—he instead appeared from the bench, replacing new Villa signing [[Shaun Maloney]]. Manager Martin O'Neill suggested that Agbonlahor, who had been playing out of position on the right wing for much of the season, had done superbly, and being dropped from the first 11 was in order to rest him, and alleviate growing crowd pressure.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Following this break, Agbonlahor went on a scoring spree. He scored from the right-wing against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 2 April, to gain Villa a valuable point.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 1–1 Everton |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6491145.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Chris |last=Bevan }}</ref> Following this match, Agbonlahor signed a new-four-year contract at Aston Villa.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Agbonlahor signs new Villa deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/6517409.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref> The following Saturday, in the absence of [[John Carew]], he was moved back to his natural position at centre forward and again found his name on the scoresheet.

Agbonlahor made it three in a row on [[Easter Monday]], again scoring an equaliser, adjudged to have crossed the line by assistant referee Dave Richardson.

===2007–08 season===
Agbonlahor also scored the vital second goal in the match between Aston Villa and Chelsea on 2 September, in which Villa won 2–0.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 2–0 Chelsea |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6963719.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2007 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article262239.ece |title=Aston Villa 2 Chelsea 0 |newspaper=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=3 September 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2007 |location=London |first=Janine |last=Self }}</ref> Agbonlahor scored the winning goal in the 86th minute of the [[Second City derby]], 60 seconds after saving the ball on the line from a [[Liam Ridgewell]] shot. After 13 games, Agbonlahor was the club's top goal scorer, with six Premier League goals. On 7 December it was announced that Agbonlahor had won the Premier League Player of the Month award and manager [[Martin O'Neill]] had won the Manager of the Month award for the same month.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Villa claim maiden Barclays Awards double |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/4d/c4/0,,12306~115789,00.pdf |publisher=Premier League |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |format=PDF }}</ref>

On 12 April 2008, Agbonlahor scored the fourth goal against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in a 6–0 victory at [[Pride Park Stadium|Pride Park]] in the Premier League.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Derby 0–6 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7332038.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Chris |last=Whyatt }}</ref> In the [[Birmingham derby]] on 20 April 2008, he scored the fifth and final goal in the 5–1 victory.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 5–1 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7344139.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 April 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Phil |last=Harlow }}</ref>

===2008–09 season===
On 15 August 2008, Agbonlahor signed a new four-year contract with Aston Villa, tying him to the club until 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Agbonlahor commits to Villains |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1366836,00.html |publisher=[[Premier League]] |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2008 }}</ref>

Following his contract extension, on 17 August 2008, Agbonlahor scored a "perfect" [[hat-trick]] (scoring goals with his head, right foot and left foot) against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in Villa's opening game of the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]] at Villa Park. The three goals were netted in the space of seven minutes, making it the second-fastest hat-trick in the history of the Premier League. He was later named [[man of the match]] for this performance, which led to a 4–2 victory.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa 4–2 Man City |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7551172.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 August 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |first=Chris |last=Bevan }}</ref>
[[File:Gabriel Agbonlahor Aston Villa-FH 318.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Agbonahor playing for Aston Villa in 2008.]]
Early in the season he began to form a successful strike partnership with team-mate [[John Carew]], this demonstrated in the Premier League away games against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7613928.stm |title=West Brom 1–2 Aston Villa |date=21 September 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=David |last=McIntyre}}</ref> and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7674189.stm |title=Wigan 0–4 Aston Villa |date=26 October 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=Dawkes }}</ref> where both players scored in both games and provided assists. On 3 November, Agbonlahor was at the centre of a controversy with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Joey Barton]] when, during the match, Barton appeared to brush his fingers on Agbonlahor's face. It later emerged that Barton's attack might have been race-orientated but, after careful consideration by both Aston Villa and the FA, no further action was taken.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7684775.stm |title=Newcastle 2–0 Aston Villa |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7707627.stm |title=FA decides not to punish Barton |date=4 November 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> On 8 November, it emerged in some national newspapers that the reason Agbonlahor decided not to pursue legal action against Barton was because he "felt sorry" for him.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/nov/05/astonvilla-newcastleunited-barton-agbonlahor |title=No Barton complaint from Agbonlahor following racism allegations |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |first=Paul |last=Doyle }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport-old/football/2008/11/07/gabriel-agbonlahor-exclusive-why-i-let-joey-barton-get-away-with-loutish-behaviour-115875-20877584/ |title=Gabriel Agbonlahor exclusive: Why I let Joey Barton get away with loutish behaviour |date=7 November 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] }}</ref> On 15 November, he scored once and played a part in the other goal, when Aston Villa beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2–0 at the [[Emirates Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7731794.stm |title=Arsenal 0–2 Aston Villa |date=15 November 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Phil |last=McNulty }}</ref> He scored a brace against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 13 December.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7763479.stm |title=Aston Villa 4–2 Bolton |date=13 December 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Caroline |last=Cheese }}</ref> Agbonlahor notched his tenth league goal of the season in the 90th minute in a 2–0 win against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 7 February.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7867070.stm |title=Blackburn 0–2 Aston Villa |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera }}</ref>

However, this was a high point in a dismal run of form in which he scored just 1 goal in 12 league games. Some fans began to get frustrated with Agbonlahor and in Villa's home defeat against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] there were some sarcastic cheers as he was substituted off by Martin O'Neill.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He was subsequently dropped to the bench for Villa's next game away to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] which Villa lost 5–0. After the heavy defeat to Liverpool and despite his lack of form Agbonlahor was recalled to the starting 11 and went on to score a goal against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 5 April in a 3–2 defeat for Villa. Agbonlahor was nominated for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] with team mate [[Ashley Young]] winning the honour.

===2009–10 season===
Agbonlahor's first goal of the [[2009-10 Premier League|2009–10 season]] came in a 2–0 home victory over [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 30 August 2009. The striker brought the ball from the centre of the field to strike, left-footed, past [[Mark Schwarzer]] from around 20 yards out.

The striker scored the only goal in the season's opening Birmingham derby against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham]], netting an open header past [[Joe Hart]] as a result of a free kick taken by Ashley Young. Agbonlahor scored his third goal of the season scoring in a 2–0 win against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Agbonlahor helps sink Portsmouth to another defeat |url=http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/match?id=269907&cc=5739 |publisher=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=19 September 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2009 }}</ref> He scored his fourth and fifth consecutive goals of the season against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the [[2009–10 Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the Premier League. His next goal came on 24 October 2009 against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] in the Premier League. Fellow Villa forward [[Emile Heskey]] played the ball into the penalty area where Agbonlahor turned a defender and placed a low shot past Wolves goalkeeper [[Wayne Hennessey]]. The game finished 2–1.

He scored the only goal in the 1–0 win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], heading in a cross from [[Ashley Young]] after 21 minutes, providing Villa's first league win at Old Trafford since 1983. Agbonlahor scored in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final against Blackburn Rovers helping Villa to get to the [[2010 Football League Cup Final|final]] where they lost to Manchester United 2–1. He scored twice in 2–0 win at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 30 January 2010. On 21 February, Agbonlahor provided an assist for Emile Heskey before adding Villa's final goal in a 5–2 victory over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] for his 11th league goal of the season.

Agbonlahor finished the season with thirteen goals in the Premier League, and 16 in all competitions.

===2010–11 season===
Despite Villa suffering some issues on and off the field at the beginning of the season such as the resignation of manager Martin O'Neill and a humiliating 6–0 defeat at the hands of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Agbonlahor defended the club and stated his intent to remain there for the long term.<ref name="skysports.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11677_6343071,00.html |title=Agbonlahor plans Villa stay |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=28 August 2010 }}</ref>

Agbonlahor signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract on 12 November 2010 keeping him at [[Villa Park]] until at least 2015.
On 16 January 2011, he made his 200th appearance in an Aston Villa shirt in a 1–1 draw with rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], playing the full 90 minutes at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrews]]. Agbonlahor scored his first goal in the Premier League since April 2010 in the 2–1 victory over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 26 January 2011 at the [[DW Stadium]]. On 16 April 2011 Agbonlahor scored an injury-time winner away at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=West Ham 1–2 Aston Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9455649.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2011 |accessdate=16 September 2011 }}</ref>

Agbonlahor was less prolific in terms of goalscoring during 2010–11 due to Aston Villa manager [[Gérard Houllier]] preferring to use him as a winger.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aston Villa: Gabby Agbonlahor prepared to keep playing on left wing |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2011/01/18/aston-villa-gabby-agbonlahor-prepared-to-keep-playing-on-left-wing-97319-28003748/ |publisher=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=18 January 2011 }}</ref>

===2011–12 season===
Agbonlahor scored his first goal of the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]] in Aston Villa's 3–1 home win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 20 August 2011, and followed this up with the leveller in a 2–2 away draw against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 10 days later.<ref>{{cite news | title = Aston Villa 3–1 Blackburn Rovers | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14514645.stm |publisher=BBC | accessdate =8 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Everton 2–2 Aston Villa | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14773325.stm |publisher=BBC | accessdate =8 October 2011}}</ref> For his positive performances during the opening month of the season, Agbonlahor was named as Aston Villa's player of the month for August 2011, beating off competition from [[Fabian Delph]] to the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2451517,00.html |title=Agbonlahor confirmed as August player of the month &#124; Aston Villa |publisher=Avfc.co.uk }}</ref> He then made it 3 goals in 3 games when he scored in a 1–1 home draw against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 17 September.<ref>{{cite news | title = Aston Villa 1–1 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14864217.stm |publisher=BBC | accessdate =8 October 2011}}</ref> This meant that Agbonlahor had equalled his Premier League goals tally from 2010–11 after just five games into the new season.

After rediscovering his goalscoring form under new boss [[Alex McLeish]], the striker publicly spoke of his discontent at the managerial tenure of [[Gérard Houllier]] and his assistant [[Gary McAllister]] and said that he even considered quitting the club had the previous regime remained.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eurosport |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/16092011/58/premier-league-agbonlahor-houllier-killed.html |title=Premier League&nbsp;– Agbonlahor: Houllier 'killed' me&nbsp;– Yahoo!

Retrieved 15 January 2012.</ref> On 3 April 2012, after Aston Villa captain Stilyan Petrov's diagnosis with acute leukaemia, Agbonlahor was named team captain upon Petrov's diagnosis.

===2012–13 season===
Following the sacking of [[Alex McLeish]] in the summer of 2012, Agbonlahor was not chosen as interim captain by McLeish's successor, [[Paul Lambert]]. The Scotsman opted firstly for [[Darren Bent]] as skipper, before choosing new signing [[Ron Vlaar]] to wear the captain's armband in the absence of Stiliyan Petrov.

Agbonlahor began the season injured, and could not make an appearance until the 1–1 away draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 2 September. He later returned to full fitness and started the away game at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 25 September. Agbonlahor managed to score two goals in the match as Aston Villa secured a memorable 4–2 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win (after extra time) over the Premier League champions at the [[City of Manchester Stadium|Etihad Stadium]]. On 3 November 2012 he scored his first Premier League goal in just under a year against [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] in a run stretching 29 games. On 6 April 2013, Agbonlahor scored his 60th Premier League goal for Aston Villa making him joint top Premier League goalscorer for the club alongside [[Dwight Yorke]]. On 29 April in a 6–1 win over Sunderland Agbonlahor scored his 61st Premier League goal to overtake Yorke as Villa's highest all-time Premier League goal scorer. He scored two goals  in a 1–2 win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 4 May, moving Aston Villa up to 13th place in the Premier League.

===2013–14 season===
Agbonlahor began the season brightly, winning two penalties in a 1–3 win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 17 August 2013 and again assisting [[Benteke]]'s goal against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] four days later in a controversial 2–1 defeat at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. This resulted in strong praise from manager [[Paul Lambert]], and a huge demand from the public for an England call up, which was ignored by [[Roy Hodgson]].

In September, Agbonlahor participated in a charity match organised by [[Stiliyan Petrov]], which featured many celebrities and footballers, both former and current. During the match, Agbonlahor tackled and injured [[One Direction]] member [[Louis Tomlinson]], who then became ill after being substituted. Despite apologising to Tomlinson, Agbonlahor received many threats after the match from One Direction fans via [[Twitter]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24014589</ref>

===2014–15 season===

On 10 September 2014, Agbonlahor signed a new four-year contract, saying "I can still remember making my debut, so to still be able to contribute is a great feeling."<ref>{{cite news|title=Gabriel Agbonlahor signs new four-year Aston Villa contract|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29149659|accessdate=10 September 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=1 September 2014}}</ref> Three days later, he scored the only goal as Villa won away at Liverpool, a club he had only scored once against before in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Chris|title=Liverpool 0-1 Aston Villa|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29090587|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=13 September 2014}}</ref>

==International career==
Agbonlahor's ancestry qualifies him to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] or [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] at international level, but he chose to play for his homeland of [[England national football team|England]].

On 20 September 2006, Agbonlahor was pencilled in as a player in the [[Nigeria national under-20 football team|Nigeria U-20]] team for the match against [[Rwanda]]. He turned down the call, whilst not ruling out playing for the country in the future,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Agbonlahor turns down Nigeria |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/5375596.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 September 2006 |accessdate=5 September 2007 }}</ref> but subsequently pledged his future to England.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/article.php3?id_article=822 |title=Nigeria, England, Scotland battle for whiz kid |newspaper=The Patriotic Vanguard |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=11 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Gab: England for Me |url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1109003,00.html |publisher=[[Aston Villa F.C.]] |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate=11 September 2007 }}</ref>

On 28 September 2006, Agbonlahor received his first call-up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U-21 squad]], and won his first U21 cap as a substitute against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] on 6 October. Agbonlahor was then omitted from the England's [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2007|U-21 Championship]] squad, by manager [[Stuart Pearce]], on 30 May 2007, as a result of missing the England U21 training camp in Spain. [[David Bentley]], also included in the [[England national football team|England first team]] line-up, took his place.

Agbonlahor was later recalled to the side by Pearce, in September 2007,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Agbonlahor in England U21 squad |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6949403.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=5 September 2007 }}</ref> netting his first goal for the under-21s, by scoring the second in a 3–0 victory, over [[Montenegro national under-21 football team|Montenegro U-21]].

On 1 February, Agbonlahor was named in [[Fabio Capello]]'s 23-man England squad to play [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in February 2008,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Capello keeps Agbonlahor in squad |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7224293.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 February 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 }}</ref> although a hamstring injury forced him to withdraw from the game.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Wright-Phillips fit for England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7225317.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 }}</ref> Agbonlahor was also an unused substitute in England's respective 2–0 and 3–0 friendly victories against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]<ref>{{Cite news |title=England 2–0 USA |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7420122.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie }}</ref> and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]]<ref>{{Cite news |title=England 3–0 Trinidad & Tobago |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7425208.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 }}</ref> in May–June 2008.

On 15 November 2008, he was called up to Capello's squad for the upcoming match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Berlin]], joining three other Aston Villa players in the squad: [[Ashley Young]], [[Curtis Davies]] and [[Gareth Barry]]. On 19 November, he was named to start against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. He played for 76 minutes,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Germany 1–2 England |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7737012.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=16 September 2011 |first=Andrew |last=McKenzie }}</ref> had a goal disallowed and received high praise from [[John Terry]], the latter describing him as "a nightmare to play against".<ref>{{Cite news |title=Aston Villa's Agbonlahor and Young impress England captain Terry |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2008/11/19/aston-villa-s-agbonlahor-and-young-impress-england-captain-terry-97319-22293018/ |newspaper=[[Birmingham Mail]] |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=30 December 2008 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Agbonlahor was one of four children born to a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother in Birmingham. However his parents separated while he was still young and he lived with his father, without any contact with his mother for around 20 years. In 2009, ahead of the striker's 23rd birthday, his mother made a public appeal to him via the city's ''[[Sunday Mercury]]'' newspaper, in order to become part of his life once more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/video-pics/midlands-birmingham-videos/2009/10/09/mother-of-aston-villa-striker-agbonlahor-pleads-to-her-son-66331-24893640/ |title=Mother of Aston Villa striker Agbonlahor pleads to her son |publisher=Sunday Mercury }} {{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> Agbonlahor later contacted his mother and the pair reconciled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/news/midlands-news/2009/10/18/aston-villa-star-gabby-agbonlahor-in-phone-call-to-estranged-mum-66331-24954733/2/ |title=Aston Villa star Gabby Agbonlahor in phone call to estranged mum |publisher=Sunday Mercury }} {{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>

Agger has been described as "a fine reader of the game, comfortable on the ball and blessed with a ferocious shot."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|title=Euro 2012: Denmark|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/jonathan_wilson/06/01/euro.2012.denmark.preview/index.html|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> 

He started his senior career with Brøndby in July 2004, winning the [[Danish Superliga]] and the [[Danish Cup]], before moving to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in January 2006. He made 175 [[Premier League]] appearances for the club and won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]]. Agger returned to Brøndby for personal reasons in August 2014.

A full international since 2005, Agger has earned over 60 caps and played for Denmark at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

==Club career==

===Brøndby IF===
[[File:Agger daniel.jpg|thumb|135px|left|At Brøndby training, 2005.]]
In July 2004, he was moved from the youth squad to the first team, following the departure of [[Sweden national football team|Swedish international]] defender [[Andreas Jakobsson]]. Agger quickly established himself not only as a first team regular, but as one of the key components in the team that won the [[2004–05 Danish Superliga]] championship. After the first half of the season Agger was named 2004 "talent of the year" by Spillerforeningen (the Danish equivalent of the [[Professional Footballers' Association|English PFA]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

After the successful Superliga 2004–05 season, Agger was called up to the senior [[Danish national football team]] for the 1–0 friendly win against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] on 2 June 2005, playing the full match.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
Agger spent the next national team match on the bench before playing the full 4–1 friendly win on 17 August 2005 over [[England national football team|England]] alongside Per Nielsen. He played the whole 90 minutes in the next two national team matches, before an injury sustained in the [[2005–06 Danish Superliga]] season in September forced him out for the remainder of 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Only 20 years of age, Daniel Agger was awarded the Danish "talent of the year" of all sports on 6 December 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==== 2005–06 season ====
Agger was long linked to a transfer to a big club, and in the January 2006 [[transfer window]], Agger got his wish and was looking to join [[Premier League]] team [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], the defending [[UEFA Champions League]] champions of Europe.<ref name="echo">Bascombe, Chris.

His first half-season at Liverpool saw injuries limit him to four first-team appearances during Spring 2006, and he missed the club's victory in the [[2006 FA Cup Final]]. In May 2006, he played 10 games and scored 3 goals for the [[Denmark under-21 national football team|Danish under-21 national team]], for which he was selected to play in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2006 European Under-21 Championship]] tournament.

Agger scored his second goal for the club in a [[Football League Cup]] away game against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] with a volley from close range during the seven minutes of first-half stoppage time.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  His third was against Arsenal, scoring a header in a 4–1 victory played on 31 March 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  In the first semi-final of the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07 Champions League]], Agger received some criticism as Liverpool lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 1–0, after Chelsea striker [[Didier Drogba]] managed to dribble past him before making the assist to win the game.<ref name="telegraph">Smith, Alan (23 May 2007).

==== 2007–08 season ====
[[File:Daniel Agger2 cropped.jpg|150px|thumb|Agger in 2008]]
Agger started the 2007 pre-season in scoring fashion, scoring two goals in four games, including a left footed-finish against Hong Kong outfit [[South China AA|South China]]. However, he suffered a [[metatarsal]] injury in September, again losing his place to Hyypiä.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In January 2008, Agger began training and was attempting to regain match fitness, however a recurrence of the injury in his second metatarsal again ruled him out of action.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} After being examined by several specialists, it was reported on [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s official website that Agger would miss the remainder of the season to undergo surgery on his foot.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==== 2008–09 season ====
Agger returned to full training in the pre-season at Melwood and on 12 July 2008 Agger made his playing return as a substitute in Liverpool's friendly win over neighbours [[Tranmere Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rice |first=Jimmy |title=Rafa: Agger loss cost us title shot |publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/rafa-agger-loss-cost-us-title-shot |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> Agger stated after the match: "I am almost starting my career at Liverpool all over again".<ref>{{cite web |last=Rice |first=Jimmy |title=Agger: It Feels Like A New Start |publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] |date=13 July 2008 |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/agger-it-feels-like-a-new-start |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> Agger was in the starting line up in Liverpool's first game of the season against Standard Liège in the Champions League qualifiers. The game ended 0–0. Agger then found himself sidelined the rest of August and much of September, and was not even included in the squad to face Manchester United. This led to rumours of a verbal exchange between Agger and Liverpool manager Benítez. However, Benítez insisted that there was no rift between Agger and himself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benitez plans Agger offer |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=23 September 2008 |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11669_4183848,00.html |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>

After a month without playing, Agger returned to the starting line up against [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] in the League Cup. Agger played the full 90 minutes and marked his return by scoring the first goal from a free kick outside the box. Liverpool won the game 2–1.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hunter |first=Andy |title=Pope's fallibility spares 'best ever' Benítez an Anfield inquisition |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=24 September 2008 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/24/carlingcup.liverpool |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>
[[File:Daniel Agger 2011.jpg|left|174px|thumb|Agger in 2011]]
Profiting in part from Škrtel's injury, Agger returned to the starting line up against Wigan for his first Premier League match of the season. Agger was, however, at least partly to blame for Wigan taking the lead when he lost the ball to Zaki after a pass from goalkeeper Reina.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Agger redeemed himself by setting up Dirk Kuyt for the equaliser.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Liverpool eventually won the match 3–2.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} On 11 April 2009, Agger scored the third goal for Liverpool from 30 yards against Blackburn Rovers. Liverpool went on to win 3–0. Agger celebrated, like the others who had scored in the match, by pointing to the sky in memory of victims in the [[Hillsborough disaster]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Burton |first=Chris |title=Kuyt inspires Reds revival |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=18 October 2008 |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3003483,00.html |accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref>

In May 2009, Agger signed a new five-year deal which if fulfilled, will see him remain with Liverpool until at least 2014.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==== 2009–10 season ====
Agger underwent surgery for a recurring back injury in August 2009 and made his return on 25 October 2009 for the 2–0 win over rivals [[Manchester United]] at [[Anfield]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

On 28 February 2010, Daniel Agger played his 100th competitive game for Liverpool, playing in the 2–1 home win against [[Blackburn Rovers]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Agger played another 14 times in 2009–10, including scoring his 7th goal for the club, an outstanding backheel, against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] and also helped Liverpool reach the semi finals of the same competition.

====2010–11 season====
[[File:Daniel Agger 2011 Singapore.jpg|186px|thumb|Agger in 2011]]
Agger appeared against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 15 August 2010, but got concussed in the second half of the game.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} As a result of the concussion, he missed the next few games. He also had other injury problems which kept him out until December.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Martin Škrtel]] was preferred rather than Agger under [[Roy Hodgson]] and he threatened to quit the club with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] reportedly interested in him.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} After departure of Hodgson, he featured in most of the games under [[Kenny Dalglish]], including the match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 6 February 2011, with Liverpool winning 1–0.

It was his first Liverpool goal since 2010, when he scored in the Europa League tie against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. On 26 February 2012, he helped Liverpool to win their first trophy since 2006 as they won the [[2012 Football League Cup Final]] but injured his ribs during the match.<ref>{{cite news|title=Daniel Agger out for 'a few weeks' with rib injury - Kenny Dalglish|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17224258|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2012}}</ref>  On 7 April 2012, Agger made his return from injury as a second-half substitute against [[Aston Villa]] at [[Anfield]], replacing [[José Enrique]] and hitting the crossbar with a header late on which led to the equalizer in a 1–1 draw.

Agger made his first start of the league campaign in a 3–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 18 August, in which he conceded a penalty and was sent off for a foul on [[Shane Long]].

'''Julius Aghahowa''' (born 12 February 1982 in [[Benin City]]) is a retired [[Nigeria]]n [[Association football|footballer]]. He is known for his pace and his back-flips when he scores goals.

Aghahowa has played for Nigeria at four [[Africa Cup of Nations]], the [[2002 World Cup]] and the [[2000 Olympics]], as well as playing top-flight football in Tunisia, Ukraine, England and Turkey.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Aghahowa began his career with the Police Machines, a local police team, and went on to [[Bendel Insurance F.C.|Bendel Insurance]]. He signed for Danish lower division team [[FC Midtjylland|Herning Fremad]] before the 1999 African Youth Championship, but Aghahowa performed so well there that he wanted to play for a bigger club. He ended up with the [[Tunisia]]n champions, [[Espérance Sportive de Tunis|Espérance]], when he procured a contract with the Tunisians which predated the Herning Fremad contract.<ref>Lars Bøgeskov, "Jyder snydt for supertalent", [[Politiken]], 27 August 1999.</ref>

===Shakhtar Donetsk===
In the middle of the 2000–01 season, Aghahowa transferred to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], who soon won the Ukrainian league championship. Aghahowa won the game for Shakhtar in the 2006 Ukrainian Championship against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], heading the winner in extra-time and being named man of the match. His performance in the final has been widely seen as the "saving grace" of his career at Shakhtar, with his future at the club looking bleak earlier in the season. After playing over six years for Shakhtar Donetsk, Aghahowa left for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].

===Wigan Athletic===
His work permit was passed and on 30 January 2007, he signed for [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for an undisclosed fee,<ref name="Agahowa close to Wigan deal">{{cite web

===Return to Shakhtar Donetsk===
On 4 July 2009, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]  signed Aghahowa on a free transfer after he was released by [[Kayserispor]]. He had already played for Shakhtar from 2000 to 2007<ref>[http://shakhtar.com/en/news/9963 Julius Aghahowa came back to Shakhtar]</ref> and declared a great desire to play for his old club. However, he could not find himself as a regular starter and was loaned out to [[PFC Sevastopol]] at the beginning of the 2010–11 season. He was released at the end of the 2011-12 season. Announcing his retirement from the game in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=uk:Агахова объявил о завершении карьеры|url=http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/high/516a4e4f.html|website=www.ua-football.com|publisher=ua-football|accessdate=20 October 2014|language=Ukrainian|date=14 April 2013}}</ref>

==International career==
Aghahowa has played 32 matches and scored 14 goals for the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian national team]], including their only goal at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. He became Nigeria's top goalscorer at the [[2002 African Nations Cup]]. He also played at the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics]].

'''Stephen Mark "Steve" Agnew''' (born 9 November 1965 in [[Shipley, West Yorkshire|Shipley]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]) is an English former professional [[association football|footballer]] and assistant Head Coach at [[Championship]] side [[Middlesbrough]].

As a player he was a [[midfielder (association football)|midfielder]] from 1983 to 2002, notably in the [[Premier League]] from [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. He also played in the [[Football League]] for [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[York City F.C.|York City]] before finishing his career in Non-league with [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]]. 

==Club career==
Agnew started his career at [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]], staying there for eight years after turning professional and playing more than 200 times. He was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for £700,000 in June 1991 — making him the [[Ewood Park]] club's most costly signing at the time, just after wealthy owner [[Jack Walker]] bought the club. His spell at Blackburn was unsuccessful, only making four appearances before he joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on loan and then [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] permanently in the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93]] season, when Rovers were in the new [[FA Premier League]] and Leicester were challenging for promotion from Division One. During his time at Blackburn, the club earned promotion to the new [[Premier League]], but Agnew's part in the success was a minimal one as the attention was focused on big-money new signings such as [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] and [[Roy Wegerle]] and later [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Stuart Ripley]]. One of Agnew's most memorable nights in a Leicester City shirt was Thursday, 15 April 1993, when Leicester beat Millwall 3–0. Agnew scored and was sent off. Agnew "reacted angrily to a heavy challenge by Andy Roberts. At least a dozen players jostled each other as police, stewards and the respective managers tried to restore order. Agnew, who had already been cautioned, appeared to lash out at a Millwall player, leaving Mr Parker no option other than to reach for red. Millwall tried hard to exploit their numerical advantage, only for the home side to score again through [[David Oldfield (footballer)|David Oldfield]]." He was part of the Leicester team which won promotion to the Premier League as Division One playoff winners in 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-leicester-maul-millwall-1455449.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Phil | last=Shaw | title=Football: Leicester maul Millwall | date=15 April 1993}}</ref>

Agnew then moved up the country to [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]], helping them win promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in 1996, although they went down after just one season, and in 1998, he signed for [[York City F.C.|York City]], and despite his efforts the [[Bootham Crescent]] side were unable to avoid relegation from Division Two in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season. Agnew spent the 2001–02 season playing for [[Gateshead F.C.|Gateshead]], where he finished his playing days.

==Managerial and coaching career==
In February 2002 Agnew moved into coaching, becoming assistant manager of Gateshead to Gary Gill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nonleaguedaily.com/news/index.php?&newsmode=FULL&nid=2608 |title=Proudlock sad to depart Gateshead |work=NonLeagueDaily.com |publisher=Non-League Today |date=11 February 2002 |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref> Both he and Gill resigned from Gateshead after the playing budget was cut in early October 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/sport/north-east-football/2002/10/04/double-quit-blow-79310-12254691/ |title=Double quit blow |first=Bob |last=Moreland |work=Sunday Sun |publisher=ncjMedia |date=4 October 2002 |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>

Agnew continued his coaching at the [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] Academy and then joined Leeds United as Reserve Team Manager in 2004. Agnew left the club to become assistant manager at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] on 23 June 2005. However, in 2006, Agnew quit his position at Hartlepool and rejoined Leeds as Under 18's manager.

He rejoined Middlesbrough as reserve team coach on 23 January 2007. He was promoted to assistant manager on 7 July 2008, following the departure of [[Steve Harrison (footballer)|Steve Harrison]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_3790225,00.html |title=Harrison leaves Boro |publisher=Sky Sports |date=7 July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008}}</ref> On 18 October 2010 he was put in temporary charge of first team matters following the resignation of Gordon Strachan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/9103816.stm |title=Gordon Strachan resigns as manager of Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC |work = BBC Sport |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> On 29 June 2012 it was announced that Agnew had taken up the post of assistant manager at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~2827486,00.html|title=New Staff Announcement|date=29 June 2012|work=The Tigers Official Website|publisher=Hull City A.F.C.|accessdate=11 June 2013|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120704135112/http://www.hullcityafc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10338~2827486,00.html|archivedate=4 July 2012}}</ref>

On 23 December 2014, it was announced that Agnew had joined [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] as assistant head coach.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30589866|title=Steve Agnew takes Middlesbrough assistant head coach role|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>

'''Manuel "Junior" Agogo''' (born 1 August 1979) is a retired [[Ghana]]ian professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a striker. He  spent most of his career in England, as well as spells in the United States, [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]] and most recently [[Scotland]]. 

In January 2015, Agogo was rushed to hospital following a suspected stroke.<ref>{{cite news |title= Fmr Ghanaian striker Junior Agogo suffers stroke |url= http://www.spyghana.com/fmr-ghanaian-striker-junior-agogo-suffers-stroke |publisher= spyghana.com |date= |accessdate= 3 February 2015}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Born in [[Accra]], [[Greater Accra Region|Greater Accra]], Agogo began his career at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1995, but only made two league appearances for the [[Premier League]] side. During the [[1999-00 in English football|1999–00]] season he had loan spells at [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]], and [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. His goal for Chester against [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] in October 1999, was voted the second-best goal ever scored at the [[Deva Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news

===United States===
In 2000 Agogo left Sheffield Wednesday and moved to the United States to play for the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. He was traded to the [[Colorado Rapids]] after playing just one match in Chicago, going on to score 11 goals in 32 appearances for the Rapids.

He was traded from Colorado to the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in June 2001 for [[Chris Carrieri]]. He played with the Earthquakes for the rest of the 2001 championship season but was waived early in the 2002 pre-season, replaced on the San Jose roster by [[Devin Barclay]].

===Back in England===
In 2002, Agogo returned to England, this time with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. However, after only two appearances he moved to [[Football Conference]] side [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] where he scored 21 goals in 39 games.

===Bristol Rovers===
In the summer of 2003, Agogo joined [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. He played the first thirteen games of the [[The Football League 2003-04|2003–04 season]] before having to have an operation which kept him out for the next nine games. He finished the campaign with 22 goals in all competitions. In the [[The Football League 2004-05|2004–05 season]], Agogo scored 20 goals in 51 appearances; the following season he scored 18 goals from 44 appearances.

===Nottingham Forest===
[[File:Agogo, Junior.jpg|thumb|left|Agogo during his [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] days.]]
In summer 2006 Rovers turned down bids from Agogo from [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and [[Football League One|League One]] side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]<ref name="Southend">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/5207420.stm|title=Southend bid for Agogo rejected|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=24 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/4787611.stm|title=Rovers reject Forest Agogo offer|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=15 August 2006}}</ref> Agogo had a clause in his contract allowing him to speak to other clubs if an acceptable bid was made.<ref name="Southend"/> On 30 August 2006 the transfer to Forest was completed for an undisclosed fee, with Agogo signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/5290450.stm|title=Forest complete signing of Agogo|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=30 August 2006}}</ref> On September 2006 he made his league debut for Forest as a sub in a home 4–0 win against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]]. He scored seven league goals over the season, with his first on 30 September 2006 against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in a 3–1 win.

On 22 September 2007 Agogo scored his first goals of the [[The Football League 2007-08|2007–08 season]], a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] – the first of his career. He netted two long-range strikes that season with a 35-yard lob of the goalkeeper in Forest's 3–0 win at [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] and a 25-yard effort in Forest's 4–1 success against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]]. However, Agogo scored only three goals after his return from the [[2008 African Cup of Nations]], one of which was against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] at Brisbane Road. He finished as Forest's top-scorer that season with thirteen goals, helping the club gain automatic promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. Agogo was sold during the summer for a fee of £565,000 to [[Zamalek SC]].

===Zamalek===
On 2 July 2008, Junior Agogo joined [[Zamalek SC]] at a time when the team needed a striker. He wore the number 19 shirt for El Zamalek but later shifted to number nine after Zamalek agreed to loan [[Amr Zaki]] to English side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for one year. Though ever since the player entered the club he could not compensate for the absence of the Egyptian international and has been having disputes with the club official regularly until it hit what seemed to be a dead end.<ref>[http://football.uk.reuters.com/world/news/L17111986.php?refresh=true Zamalek sign Ghana striker Agogo | Football | Reuters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.kickoff.com/static/news/article.php?id=7874</ref>

===Apollon Limassol===

Agogo joined Apollon Limassol on 5 August 2009, signing a two-year contract with the Cypriots.<ref>http://www.ghanasoccernet.com/content/view/3572/51/</ref>

=== Hibernian ===

Agogo signed a one year contract with [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], who were managed by his former Nottingham Forest manager, [[Colin Calderwood]], in July 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Baptism-of-fire-for-Junior.6804518.jp|title=Baptism of fire for Junior Agogo|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011|work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]|first=David |last=Hardie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/20110726/striker-joins-hibernian_2262950_2402420|title=Striker Joins Hibernian |publisher=[[Hibernian F.C.]]|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> Agogo scored his first goal for Hibs on 24 September 2011, in a 3–3 draw against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/spl/3837889/Junior-vows-to-repay-Hibs-boss-Caldo.html|title=All Agogo for Junior |date=27 September 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011|work=[[The Scottish Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|first=Robert|last=Martin}}</ref> He was released from his contract in January 2012, after making 14 appearances for the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16499168.stm|title=Hibs release Junior Agogo after Thornhill and Palsson exits|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref>

== International career ==
In May 2006 Agogo was called up by [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] for a friendly against French league side [[OGC Nice]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/4974132.stm|title=Striker Agogo earns Ghana call-up|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 June 2008|date=4 May 2006}}</ref> However, he was not included in the final Ghanaian [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] squad. He was recalled to the Ghana squad for an East Asia tour in which he faced [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].

On 14 November 2006, Agogo scored his first goal for Ghana, the equaliser in a friendly against [[Australia national football team|Australia]]; the game finished 1–1. He also scored the third goal in Ghana's 4–1 victory over [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], played at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford's]] [[Griffin Park]].

Agogo was called up to the Ghana squad for the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]]. He played in the first game of the cup against Guinea, hitting the post with a header in the 20th minute and helping Ghana to a 2–1 victory. He then scored in the following game against Namibia, tapping home [[Michael Essien]]'s cross for the only goal of the game.

Agogo then netted another goal, the winner in the quarter final against Nigeria. Ghana missed out on the final, however, and had to settle for a third-place play-off against the [[Côte d'Ivoire national football team|Côte d'Ivoire]], in which he scored again in 4–2 victory. Alongside [[Sulley Muntari]] he was Ghana's top scorer in the competition.

In total, Agogo scored 12 goals in 27 matches for the national team between 2006 and 2009.<ref>{{NFT player|pid=8111}}</ref>

==Club career==

===Independiente===
Sergio Agüero joined the youth system of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] at the age of nine. He started playing for the side, becoming the youngest player to debut in the division at 15 years and 35 days (on 5 July 2003 against [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro]]), when Independiente's coach, [[Oscar Ruggeri]] sent Agüero onto the field as a substitute for [[Emanuel Benito Rivas|Emanuel Rivas]] in the 69th minute of the match.<ref name=rise>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384547.stm|title=The Rise of Sergio Aguero|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/deportes/23/millones/menor/edad/elpepidep/20060601elpepidep_1/Tes |title=23 millones por un menor de edad |publisher=Elpais.com |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> His performance was well received by the press,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/07/06/d-06215.htm |title=San Lorenzo, de la galera |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.ole.com.ar/diario/2003/07/06/c-585306.htm |title=Diario Deportivo Olé – Pájaro de buen Agüero |publisher=Old.ole.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/509319-muy-frio-san-lorenzo-gano-un-clasico-pobre |title=Muy frío: San Lorenzo ganó un clásico pobre – 06.07.2003 |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date= |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> Despite his early debut, Agüero was not selected again by Ruggeri, and his replacement [[Osvaldo Sosa]], for the remainder of [[2002–03 Argentine Primera División|2002–03 season]], having only made just one appearance in the [[2002–03 in Argentine football|Torneo Clausura]]. Following the arrival of coach [[Jose Omar Pastoriza]], seven months after Agüero's first match he returned to the club's first-team in 4–2 win against [[Peru|Peru's]] [[Cienciano]] during the group stages of the [[2004 Copa Libertadores]]. This meant that Agüero also became the youngest player to participate in the [[Copa Libertadores]], a record that he held for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=341620 |title=La Crónica de Hoy &#124; Prematuro debut, ¿el prólogo de una gran carrera? |publisher=Cronica.com.mx |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> One month later, Agüero again featured in a Copa Libertadores fixture against [[Ecuador|Ecuador's]] [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|El Nacional]].

During the [[2005–06 in Argentine football|2005–06 season]], Agüero scored 18 goals in 36 league appearances, having missed two games due to suspension.

===Atlético Madrid===

====2006–07 season====
In May 2006, Agüero joined Spanish club [[Atlético Madrid]] for a fee reported to be around [[Euro sign|€]]23 million, breaking the club's previous transfer record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369484&cc=5739|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|title=Atlético agree fee for Independiente starlet}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=369713&cc=4716|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|title=Atlético sign Argentine prodigy Agüero}}</ref> He caused controversy early in his Atlético career by using his hands to score the winning goal against [[Recreativo de Huelva]] on 14 October 2006, only his second goal for the club, with the first coming in a 4–1 away win against [[Athletic Bilbao]] on 17 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=204980&cc=null&league=ESP.1|publisher=ESPN|title=Atlético Madrid 2–1 Recreativo Huelva}}</ref> He ended his first season in Madrid with 7 goals in all competitions, eased into European football by manager [[Javier Aguirre]], who opted to bring him in and out of the line-up as Atlético finished seventh – enough to qualify for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]].

====2007–08 season====
Following the departure of strike partner [[Fernando Torres]] to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the summer of 2007, Agüero secured his starting spot for the ''Rojiblancos'' and soon became arguably the team's most important player at the age of just 19. In the [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08 season]], he finished third highest scorer in [[La Liga]], behind [[Daniel Güiza]] and [[Luís Fabiano]], with 19 goals, and was runner up in the ''[[Trofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'' award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202736803447/noticia/Noticia/Raul_wins_the_Di_Stefano_Trophy.htm|publisher=Real Madrid|title=Marca names the Madridista captain the best player of the league}}</ref> Agüero won many plaudits for his [[man of the match]] display against [[FC Barcelona]] in March 2008, scoring twice, assisting a goal, and winning a penalty for Atlético in a 4–2 win.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/mar/03/europeanfootball.barcelona|publisher=The Guardian|title=A masterclass from Atlético Madrid's Sergio Agüero dented Barcelona's title hopes and made several Catalan headline-writers look very foolish indeed | location=London|first=Sid|last=Lowe|date=3 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Sergio Aguero – Readers Q&A |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7384770.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=7 May 2008}}</ref> He also scored important goals against the likes of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF]], [[Sevilla FC]], and [[Villarreal CF]] to help Atlético finish fourth and qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in over ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerway.com/news/2008/May/12/atletico-de-madrid-confirm-return-to-europes-elite|title=Atletico de Madrid confirm return to Europe's elite|date=12 May 2008|work=soccerway.com}}</ref>

====2008–09 season====
Agüero was once again a regular goalscorer for Atlético in the [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09 season]], continuing to establish a lethal partnership with [[Uruguay]]an striker [[Diego Forlán]], also a former Independiente player. On 16 September, he scored his first Champions League goals in a 3–0 away win at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], helping Atlético eventually reach the last 16 of the competition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3059895,00.html|title=PSV Eindhoven 0–3 Atlético Madrid | work=Sky Sports}}</ref> In March 2009, the duo of Forlán and Agüero scored a [[Brace (sports)#In other fields|brace]] each in a 4–3 win over league leaders Barcelona, the latter scoring the winning goal in the final minutes of the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SPORT/football/03/01/spain.barcelona/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Atletico stun Barcelona as Real close up|accessdate=7 June 2009 | date=1 March 2009}}</ref> With the help of more vital goals in a formidable end of the season run-in from his team, Agüero finished in the top ten contenders for the [[Pichichi Trophy]], which was won by his teammate Forlán.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://es.eurosport.yahoo.com/01062009/15/uruguayo-forlan-gano-pichichi-bota-oro.html|publisher=Eurosport|title=El uruguayo Forlán ganó el 'pichichi' y la 'Bota de Oro'|language=Spanish|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=26 June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Atlético finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the following season's [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

====2009–10 season====
Despite not being as prolific in front of goal, Agüero had another good season in [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10]], and was praised for his influential performances as Atlético enjoyed their most successful season in over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/04/07/futbol/equipos/atletico/1270634644.html|title=Quique Sánchez Flores and Diego Forlán prefer Sergio Agüero to Lionel Messi (Spanish)|publisher=Marca|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref> On 3 November 2009, he scored twice against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] during a 2–2 draw in the Champions League at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium|Vicente Calderón]].

The [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]] was arguably Agüero's most successful for Atlético, as he scored 20 league goals for the first time in his career.

==International career==

===Youth===

Aké has represented the Netherlands at every youth level since his Under-15 début in 2009, making 54 appearances in total.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://au.soccerway.com/players/nathan-ake/182930/? |title=N. AKÉ | publisher = SOCCERWAY |accessdate=26 Sep 2014}}</ref>

==Style of play==
Aké has been praised for his versatility due to be being able to play at left back, centre back and in a defensive midfield role. This versatility is a result of his good work ethic and professionalism combined with his gifted technique. His playing style and appearance have led to comparisons being drawn with former Dutch legend and Chelsea player [[Ruud Gullit]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2278552/Chelsea-youth-player-Nathan-Ake-looks-like-Ruud-Gullit-plays-like-David-Luiz.html |title=Ruud boy: Chelsea youth star Ake is a mini Gullit with his dreadlocks and cool head| publisher = Daily Mail |accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}</ref>

'''Bülent Akın''' (born 28 August 1978 in [[Brussels]]) is a [[Belgian]]-born Turkish former [[Association football|footballer]].<ref name="Yeni Malatyaspor"/>

==Club career==
Akin's potential was noticed after [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] legend [[Gheorghe Hagi]] remarked on how well the young midfielder had marked him in a match between Galatasaray and Akin's club, Denizilispor. Galatasaray subsequently signed Akin, but he failed to live up to the expectation.<ref name="Yeni Malatyaspor">http://www.sabah.com.tr/Spor/2010/08/12/bir_zamanlar_8_milyon_dolardi</ref> Nonetheless, he managed to win the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in [[2000 UEFA Super Cup|2000]] with the club.

'''Adeola Oluwatoyin "Ade" Akinbiyi''' (born 10 October 1974) is a [[Association football|footballer]] who is currently a player-coach at [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]].

Akinbiyi has had a much-travelled career with many different clubs with transfer fees totalling more than £11.5 million during his career, including being [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]'s record signing (at £5.3 million).<ref name="Notts County swoop for Akinbiyi">{{cite news| title = Notts County swoop for Akinbiyi| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/notts_county/8276493.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 26 September 2009|accessdate = 13 October 2009}}</ref>

Born in England, Akinbiyi qualifies to play for the [[Nigeria national football team]] through his parents, and earned one [[cap (sport)|cap]] for Nigeria.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Akinbiyi began his career as a trainee at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], where he worked his way up into the first team in 1992. He made his début on 3 November 1993 as a substitute against German giants [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[UEFA Cup 1993-94|UEFA Cup]]. [[Bayern Munich v Norwich City|The match]] ended 1–1, meaning that Norwich won the second round tie 3–2 on aggregate and went on to face [[Inter Milan]], who eliminated them.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2001/11/02/sfnwin03.xml|title=On the Spot: Ade Akinbiyi|date=2 November 2001 | first=Henry | last=Winter | accessdate=23 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
He was loaned to [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] before completing a £250,000 move to [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 1997. He scored 29 goals in 67 league and cup games for the Gills and was quickly transferred to newly promoted [[Football League First Division|Division One]] side [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] for £1.2m.

===Big money moves===
Akinbiyi's stock continued to rise and after scoring 21 goals for Bristol City in the [[1998-99 in English football|1998–99 season]], [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] paid a club record £3.5million for him in September 1999 in an attempt to replace [[Robbie Keane]]. He played only one season at [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]], finishing as the club's top goalscorer with 16 goals but Wolves just missed out on a playoff place.

Ten months after arriving at Wolves, he departed to [[Premier League]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] for £5.5 million,<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4624182.stm  |title=Akinbiyi swaps Wolves for Foxes |date=25 July 2000}}</ref> a decision he would later regret.<ref name="Akinbiyi reveals Leicester regret">{{cite news |title=Akinbiyi reveals Leicester regret |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/4448704.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 November 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2008}}</ref> Brought in as a replacement for [[Emile Heskey]] (who left for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for £11 million), he failed to live up to expectations, scoring only 11 goals in 58 league appearances.

His spell at Leicester hit rock bottom in a 4-1 defeat at home to Liverpool. He missed four easy chances, including a miss from six yards in the last minute. He was booed by Leicester fans whose patience with Akinbiyi had run out.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/oct/22/match.leicestercity |title=Fowler returns to finishing school |date=22 October 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> Soon after, he scored his first goal of the season in a crucial 1-0 win at home to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], which prompted him to say that "hopefully this will start a flood of goals for me".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/nov/05/match.leicestercity |title=First Ade patches up struggling Foxes |date=5 November 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

Leicester transferred Akinbiyi to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] for £2.2m in February 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Palace clinch Akinbiyi deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/1801306.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref> On arrival he took the surprisingly high number 55 shirt, adding a very small plus sign between the numbers to signify his preferred shirt number, 10, which was already taken. Having scored just one goal in 14 league and cup appearances, he was loaned out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title=Deadline-day transfers |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2891031.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=27 March 2003 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref> He scored twice&nbsp;– the second goal coming in the last game of the [[2002-03 Stoke City F.C. season|2002–03]] season, when the Potters beat [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 1–0 to retain their second tier status.<ref>{{cite web |title=Akinbiyi keeps Stoke up |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/2967967.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> He later joined on a permanent basis, on a free transfer in September 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stoke seal Akinbiyi deal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/3105718.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=13 September 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> He scored ten goals in [[2003–04 Stoke City F.C. season|2003–04]] and won the [[Stoke City F.C.

===Burnley===
Akinbiyi completed a £600,000 move to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in February 2005, but marked his debut by getting sent off within two minutes for head butting [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] player [[George McCartney]]. After netting 16 times for ''the Clarets'', he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a then club record £1.75 million in January 2006.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/4624182.stm|title=Akinbiyi and Dyer move to Blades|date=26 January 2006}}</ref>

===Sheffield United===
Akinbiyi scored on his debut for ''the Blades'' against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and endeared himself to fans by scoring in his first [[Steel City derby]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]]. After winning promotion, Akinbiyi made only five appearances for ''the Blades'' in the Premier League in 2006. It was also reported that he was involved in a training ground bust-up with team-mate [[Claude Davis]] in October 2006 following a 2–0 defeat against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in which Davis had been sent off.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_utd/6090316.stm|title=Akinbiyi and Davis resolve feud |date=27 October 2006}}</ref>

===Return to Burnley===
Akinbiyi was soon resold to Burnley in January 2007 for a fee of £650,000 with a further £100,000 to be paid in the summer of 2007.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/6222637.stm|title=Burnley re-sign Blades' Akinbiyi|date=1 January 2007}}</ref> His second debut for the Clarets was more successful, scoring a goal against top flight [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in the [[FA Cup]].

During the rest of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season, Akinbiyi was not as successful as during his first spell at [[Turf Moor]], scoring three goals. This was attributed by [[Steve Cotterill]] to Akinbiyi having spent too much time in the weights room at Sheffield United and as a result being too bulky.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Lancashire Evening Telegraph|url=http://archive.lancashireeveningtelegraph.co.uk/2007/1/30/965540.html|title=Ade hit with weights ban|date=30 January 2007}}</ref> He was given the number nine shirt for the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08]] season but found himself behind [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1977)|Andy Gray]] and [[Robbie Blake]] as a first choice striker. After going back to Burnley, Akinbiyi lacked consistent form, finding goals harder to come by. His hard work and endeavour made him a firm fans' favourite.<ref name="Ade Akinbiyi&nbsp;— An appreciation">{{cite news|publisher=Clarets Mad|url=http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/loadfeat.asp?cid=EDB5&id=440744|title=Ade Akinbiyi&nbsp;– An appreciation|date=2 April 2009}}</ref> During the [[2008-09 in English football|2008–09]] season, his regular position on the bench was taken by youngster [[Jay Rodriguez]], a player who he had been mentoring.<ref name="Ade Akinbiyi&nbsp;— An appreciation"/> However, Akinbiyi regained his place on the bench in the fifth round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] and in the 69th minute he scored to make the game 1–1 and take it into extra time. Burnley won 5–4 on penalties. While at Burnley, Steve Cotterill, Burnley's then manager, banned him from the gym. "I wasn’t playing at Sheffield so the only thing I was doing was weights. We didn’t even have reserve games and it was something to do. I put on a bit too much muscle and I lost about a yard of pace", he said. "I try to stay away from the weights room now. I’m sort of addicted."

===Houston Dynamo===
On 26 March 2009, Akinbiyi was reported to be in talks about a move to the United States to join [[Major League Soccer]] club [[Houston Dynamo]].<ref name="Chronicle6342699">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/6342699.html|title=Dynamo close to signing veteran Akinbiyi|last=Fallas|first=Bernardo|date=26 March 2009|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> On 30 March, Akinbiyi was officially unveiled as a Houston player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houston.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090330&content_id=232988&vkey=news_hou&fext=.jsp&team=t200 |title=Soccer for Success Day|publisher=Houston Dynamo|date= 30 March 2009|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> He made his MLS debut on 3 May, as a late [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a game against [[New England Revolution]].<ref>[http://web.mlsnet.com/scoreboard/game.jsp?match=05032009_HOUNE Major League Soccer]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

To make room on the roster for [[Luis Ángel Landín]], the club's first [[Designated Player Rule|Designated Player]], the Dynamo released Akinbiyi on 20 August 2009.<ref>[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090820&content_id=6522206&vkey=pr_hou&fext=.jsp&team=t200 Major League Soccer]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

===Notts County===
After his release by Houston, Akinbiyi agreed terms with [[League Two]] side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref name="Notts County swoop for Akinbiyi"/> He made his debut on 17 October 2009 in a 0–0 draw against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], coming on as a substitute for [[Lee Hughes]] in the 82nd minute.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rotherham 0&nbsp;– 0 Notts County|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_3/8295726.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091021121445/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_3/8295726.stm| archivedate= 21 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On 10 May 2010 it was announced that he had been released by Notts County along with seven other players.<ref>{{cite news

===Free agent (2010-2013)===

In January 2011, after 9 months without a club, Akinbiyi was on the verge of joining [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] in the [[Conference National]]. He had been training with Premier League club [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], and was recommended to Newport by Stoke's Newport-born manager [[Tony Pulis]]; Pulis had been Akinbiyi's manager at Stoke between 2003 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/sport/8776176.County_sign_former_Premiership_star__Ade_Akinbiyi/|title=Akinbiyi joins Newport County|work=South Wales Argus|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> However, Newport subsequently pulled out of the deal.

Akinbiyi spent the next two years as a free agent; having been without a club for three years, he was widely assumed to have retired from football by the time of his signing for [[Conference North]] side [[Colwyn Bay F.C.|Colwyn Bay]] in the summer of 2013.

'''Philippe Julien Albert''' (born 10 August 1967) is a former Belgian [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]]. He played for [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]], [[KV Mechelen]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in his native Belgium, and for English clubs [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]. It was at Newcastle that he became known as an attack-minded [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for his forward runs from defence in the team dubbed as "the Entertainers".<ref name=moore>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Glenn|title=Football: Albert able to call tune on the Tyne: A Belgian centre-back's attacking verve is delighting the Newcastle faithful. Glenn Moore reports|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-albert-able-to-call-tune-on-the-tyne-a-belgian-centrebacks-attacking-verve-is-delighting-the-newcastle-faithful-glenn-moore-reports-1445613.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=29 October 1994}}</ref>

Albert made 41 appearances for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] from 1987 to 1997, and represented his country at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] World Cups.

==Club career==
Albert started his career with [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] before moving to [[KV Mechelen]] where his performances won him [[Belgian Golden Shoe]] and a move to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]]. While playing at Anderlecht, he won the Belgian League twice and helped his national side qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].

Albert's exploits at the World Cup earned him a £2.6 million transfer to [[Kevin Keegan]]'s [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]; he was issued the number 27 shirt, and completed the transfer on his 27th birthday.<ref name=pet/> He later claimed he turned down moves to Italian clubs [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[AC Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] the year before as did not like the a hot climate or having to play on Sundays, and moved to Newcastle as he was a fan of Keegan and the team he played for, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], in his youth.<ref name=pet/> He was an immediate success in the side as he helped them win their first six league games of the [[1994-95 Newcastle United F.C. season|1994–95 season]], but missed the later stages of the season through injury and Newcastle finished sixth – not even enough for a [[UEFA Cup]] place.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/clubbyclub-guide-the-prospects-the-players-to-watch-the-arrivals-and-departures-1596119.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Ridley | title=Club-by-club guide: The prospects, the players to watch, the arrivals and departures | date=13 August 1995}}</ref> He became a cult hero at Newcastle United due to his less-than-defensive tendencies in "the Entertainers'" central defence, would often make runs forward and be found roaming on the edge of the opposition box. His most famous moment arguably came when he scored an audacious chip from 20 yards over [[Peter Schmeichel]] in a 5–0 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 20 October 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Thom|title=Manchester United v Newcastle United: Five memorable moments including Rooney, Cantona and Phillipe Albert|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/9568715/Manchester-United-v-Newcastle-United-Five-memorable-moments-including-Rooney-Cantona-and-Phillipe-Albert.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Luke|title=Flashback: The day Newcastle United shocked Manchester United with 5-0 victory at St James' Park|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united/10501532/Flashback-The-day-Newcastle-United-shocked-Manchester-United-with-5-0-victory-at-St-James-Park.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 December 2013}}</ref>

Fans at Newcastle created a terrace chant for the player, singing "Phillipe, Phillipe Albert, everyone knows his name" to the words of the theme song of 1970s children's TV series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]''.<ref name=moore/><ref name=pet/>

Injuries towards the end of the decade limited his first-team chances and he spent 13 games on loan to third-tier club [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (managed at the time by his former Newcastle boss Keegan), scoring twice during the [[1998-99 Fulham F.C. season|1998–99 season]] as they were promoted from [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] as champions.

On leaving Newcastle in 1999, Albert returned to Belgium, rejoining Charleroi for £600,000. He spent one season with the club before retiring from football.

==International career==
Albert made 41 appearances for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author=Mamrud, Roberto|title=Belgium – Record International Players|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/belg-recintlp.html|date=16 July 2009|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> making his debut in 1987, but came to worldwide prominence at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. There he played in four of Belgium's matches, scoring against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in his first game and against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the second round match, which Belgium lost 3–2.

==Post-playing career==
Albert is now working as a pundit for Belgian TV, and also runs a successful fruit and vegetable company.<ref name=pet>{{cite web|last=Marshall|first=Paul|title=Au revoir, pet|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=615010&cc=5901|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=1 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Fan 'completes' 1996 Premier League sticker album|date = 19 November 2013|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-24992646|accessdate = 22 November 2013|work = [[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>

'''Martin Albrechtsen''' (born 31 March 1980) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[association football|football]] player, currently playing for the Danish superliga team [[Brøndby IF]]. He can play in any position across the back four and has played four games for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]]. He is the older brother of [[Jacob Albrechtsen]].

==Career==

===Akademisk Boldklub (AB)===
Born in [[Værløse]] in the [[Capital Region of Denmark]], Albrechtsen started his career at [[Akademisk Boldklub|Akademisk Boldklub (AB)]]. Alongside later Danish international [[Peter Løvenkrands]], he was called up for the Danish under-19 national team in September 1997. In February 1998 they both signed their first professional contracts with AB, joining the senior squad which competed in the [[Danish Superliga]] championship. In the  1998-99 season, he scored 1 league goal in 9 games for tAB, while the following season he scores one goal in 31 league games. 

Albrechtsen was a part of the AB team which won the 1999 [[Danish Cup]], and he was named 2000 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish ''under-21 Talent of the Year'']]. He made his debut for the [[Denmark national football team]] under national team manager [[Morten Olsen]] in April 2001. As AB struggled financially, Albrechtsen was sold to defending Superliga champions [[F.C. Copenhagen]] (FCK) in a [[Danish krone|DKK]] 9 million [[transfer deal]] in January 2002.

===F.C. Copenhagen===
Albrechtsen signed a 4½-year contract with Copenhagen, looking to replace former team captain [[Jacob Laursen]] in the central defence. In total he played 14 league games for Løverne in the latter part of the  2001-02-season,  while he made 27 league matches in 2002-03. He helped the club.win the 2003 and 2004 Danish Superliga championships, as well as the 2004 Danish Cup trophy. His performances for the club led to two additional national team matches, but after an unimpressive effort during the 0–2 loss to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in April 2003, his national team career went on a hiatus. He made his debut for the club on 3 March 2002 when they played 0–0 against AGF. Albrechtsen made his first European appearance for Copenhagen on 27 November 2003 when they drew 1–1 at Mallorca in a match in the UEFA Cup. 

===West Bromwich Albion===
In June 2004, he moved abroad to play for English club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the [[FA Premier League]]. He was bought in a £2.5 million transfer deal, making him the most expensive player the club had ever bought at that point.<ref>{{cite news

Albrechtsen was a regular for Albion during 2004–05, helping them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He also figured prominently during the following season, and scored his first ever goal for the club in the 1–0 win against [[Wigan Athletic]] at the [[JJB Stadium]] in January 2006.<ref>{{cite news

After an absence of more than three years, he was recalled for the Danish national team in November 2006.

Despite being signed as a central-defender, Albrechtsen had, prior to the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08 season]], been utilised mainly as a full-back. In August 2007 however, Albion manager [[Tony Mowbray]] decided to move the Danish player back into the centre of defence.<ref name="Ton-up">{{cite news

In January 2003, Alcaraz signed for [[Portugal|Portuguese]] club [[S.C. Beira-Mar]].

During the early stages of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld established himself in the first team and starting eleven. He became first choice centre-back along with fellow Belgian [[Jan Vertonghen]] (Jan Vertonghen now plays for Tottenham Hotspur) after the departure of former captain [[Thomas Vermaelen]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Wij hebben de beste selctie van Nederland'|last=Zwartkruis|first=Simon|work=Association football|date=30 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref> New coach [[Martin Jol]] praised the two defenders and kept faith in the duo after a string of good performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-en-alderweireld-dat-ziet-iedereen.aspx|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen en Alderweireld, dat ziet iedereen'|publisher=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Coerts|first=Stefan |title =Ajax Coach Martin Jol Praises Jan Vertonghen And Toby Alderweireld | url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2009/09/30/1532572/ajax-coach-martin-jol-praises-jan-vertonghen-and-toby |work=Goal| date = 13 October 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref> During the 4 September win against [[SC Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] that ended 3–0, he scored his first league goal for the club when he opened the scoring with a header from [[Luis Suárez]]'s corner.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271817&cc=3888&league=NED.1 Report: SC Heracles Almelo vs Ajax Amsterdam]</ref> On 27 January, he scored a late equaliser in extra time during the [[2009-10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] [[2009-10 KNVB Cup#Quarter finals|quarter final]] against [[NEC Nijmegen]] and [[Siem de Jong]]'s late goal five minutes before the final whistle sealed a 3–2 win for Ajax. At the end of the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]], Alderweireld was named "Ajax Talent of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/6550355/__Supporters_Ajax_eren_Suarez__.html |title=Supporters Ajax eren Suarez |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref> He assured himself of a place in the Eredivisie giants' history books on 3 November 2011, heading in Ajax's 100th UEFA Champions League goal in the 2–1 Group G defeat by [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1590396.html |title=Ajax's Alderweireld thrives on art of defending |publisher=UEFA.com by Berend Scholten|date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> In the [[2010-11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]], he scored a stunning 25-yard strike at the [[San Siro]] against [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group rivals [[AC Milan]] in a 0–2 away win. He followed this spectacular goal with an even more impressive 32-yard strike against [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] in a 2–0 home win.
[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|left|Alderweireld with Ajax teammates in 2011.]]
In the 2011–12 season Alderweireld has made significant strides in his ability as a footballer. He has also formed a formidable partnership in the heart of the Ajax defensive with captain and fellow Belgian Jan Verthongen. Alderweireld has also showed some impressive offensive ability scoring a remarkable goal against [[SC Heerenveen]] in Week 2.

On 5 August 2012, during the [[2012 Johan Cruijff Schaal|Johan Cruijff Schaal]] encounter between [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and Ajax, Alderweireld managed to score for Ajax in the 44th minute, bringing his club back within a goals difference going into halftime 2–1. Unfortunately, it was a match Ajax would lose 4–2, making it the third Dutch Super Cup that Alderweireld participated in and finished as runners-up. The following 2012–13 season however would be a successful one, marking the third year in a row that Alderweireld would play [[UEFA Champions League]] football, and also winning his third consecutive [[Eredivisie]] title for Ajax and 32nd overall, having played as a starting Center Back for Ajax in all three championship pursuits. Alderweireld scored a further three goals that season for Ajax, including two goals during the regular season against [[PEC Zwolle]] and [[FC Twente]], as well as scoring another goal in a 2–0 home victory against [[Steaua București]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], in the first leg of the 32nd Round of the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]]. Having been drawn into a group with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and eventual runners-up [[Borussia Dortmund]] during their Champions League campaign, Ajax had entered into the Europa League at the knockout phase having secured third place in their group, but failed to advance, losing in the second leg match in [[Romania]] 4–2 on penalty kicks after extra time.

With one more year remaining on his contract, Alderweireld opted not to extend his contract with Ajax, and received plenty of interest during the off season, with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] being mentioned as the most keen to sign the young defender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.de/bayer-04-leverkusen/alderweireld-soll-kommen-kadlec-wechselt-zu-fenerbahce,3288,23318686.html |title=Alderweireld soll kommen Kadlec wechselt zu Fenerbahce |publisher=Express.de by Lars Werner.com|date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |title=Napoli wil tien miljoen euro betalen voor Toby Alderweireld |publisher=Nieuws.be by Voetbal4U.com|date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

==International career==
[[File:Match Algérie vs Belgique, Coupe du Monde 2014, Brésil.jpg|thumb|Alderweireld playing at the [[2014 World Cup]] against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]]]
Alderweireld first represented [[Belgium]] at [[Belgium national youth football team|U17 level]] in October 2005 and took part in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2006 UEFA U17 Championship]]. After the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]] concluded, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national team]] in a friendly tournament. However his full senior debut came three months later, in a match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. He was named in several [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]] squads, but was mostly an unused substitute. In October 2009, he came on as a second-half substitute for [[Daniel Van Buyten]] in the 2–0 defeat to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]].

Alderweireld was called up to the [[Belgium national under-21 football team|Belgian U21 squad]] for the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification|2011 UEFA U21 Championship qualifier]] against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]] on 13 November 2009, with the match finishing 2–0 to Ukraine. He played [[Defender (football)|right back]] during
the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 UEFA Euro qualification]] match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 7 September 2010.

On 13 May 2014, Alderweireld was named in the squad to go to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}</ref> He started in Belgium's first game of the tournament, a 2–1 win against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Belo Horizonte]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Belgium 2–1 Algeria|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 June 2014}}</ref>

'''Rati Aleksidze''' ({{lang-ka|რატი ალექსიძე}}; born 3 August 1978 in [[Tbilsi]]) is a [[soccer|football]] [[striker]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], who plays for FC Dila Gori

== Career ==
His club career started in [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in the 1996/97 season. His goal-scoring abilities helped them win the league titles in 1997, 1998 and 1999 as well as the 1997 cup. During his Dinamo career Aleksidze scored 33 goals in 71 appearances, and especially the 12 goals in 14 games in the 1999/00 season attracted the interest of bigger European clubs. He was taken on trial to English team [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who decided to buy him. Aleksidze found first team opportunities at Chelsea hard to come by, however, as he only played in two league games and one [[UEFA Cup|European]] match, all as substitute.<ref>http://www.bounder.friardale.co.uk/Appearances/Aa-Az.htm</ref> Released by Chelsea in September 2001, he eventually returned to Dinamo where he scored nine goals in his first season. In 2004 he was bought by Russian team [[FC Rostov]], then retired from his professional career and returned to Georgia.<ref>http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/georgiasoccer/AleksidzeNew.html&date=2009-10-25+22:35:11</ref> In July 2008 he made a comeback, playing for [[FC Lokomotivi Tbilisi]]. Then in January 2009 he joined the Hungarian club [[Győri ETO FC]].<ref>http://forum.nyugat.hu/lofiversion/index.php/t1829.html</ref>

== International ==
Due to career difficulties he lost his place on the [[Georgia national football team|national team]], for which he scored 2 goals in 19 caps between 1998 and 2004.

'''Alex Rodrigo Dias da Costa''', better known as '''Alex''' ({{IPA-pt|aˈlɛks|pron}}; born 17 June 1982), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and the [[Brazil national football team]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]]. Alex is known for his physical strength and the power of his shot, which has gained him the nickname of "The Tank".<ref name=Tank/>

Having been bought by the [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2004, he was loaned to Dutch team [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and he won 3 [[Eredivisie]] titles with them. Alex finally joined the Chelsea squad in the summer of 2007 after three years in the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Chelsea target Alex earns permit | work=BBC Football | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6274174.stm | accessdate=2 August 2007  | date=2 August 2007}}</ref> In his time at Chelsea, he won the [[2009 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2009]] and a [[2009-10 Chelsea F.C. season|league and FA Cup "double" in 2010]], as well as reaching the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]]. He joined [[Paris Saint-Germain]] for £4.2 million in January 2012 and won [[Ligue 1]] twice with the club, moving to Milan on the expiration of his contract in 2014.

Alex earned 17 caps for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] between 2003 and 2008, winning the [[2007 Copa América]] and finishing as runner-up at the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

==Club career==

===Santos===
Alex began his career with [[Santos FC|Santos]] of Brazil, making his first team debut in 2002 before later becoming part of the club's central pillars. Alex made his professional league debut in the 1–1 draw against [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]]. Less than a month after his debut, Alex scored his first goal for the club in a match against [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] on 18 September 2002. After multiple impressive performances, Alex secured his place in the team's regular starting lineup. In his first season playing, in
2002, Santos won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] title, their first since 1968.

In the 2003 season, Alex participated in 34 matches and, despite playing defense, managed to score nine goals. Also in 2003, Alex helped Santos reach the [[2003 Copa Libertadores|final]] of the [[2003 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]], where Santos lost 5–1 on aggregate against Argentine side [[Boca Juniors]]. In the second leg of Copa Libertadores Finals, Alex scored the only goal for Santos in a 3–1 loss.

Alex was signed by English [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2004 on the recommendation of famed [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and Chelsea scout [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]], but because of potential problems in attaining a [[work permit]], he was [[loan (football)|loaned out]] to Dutch [[Eredivisie]] club PSV.<ref>{{cite news | title=Piet De Visser – Internationaal Voetbalscout| url=http://www.psvzone.nl/selectie_stafflid.php?id=4 | publisher=PSVZone | accessdate=10 December 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060630150732/http://www.psvzone.nl/selectie_stafflid.php?id=4 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 30 June 2006}}</ref>

===PSV (loan)===
[[File:Alex psv.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Alex with [[Phillip Cocu]] (behind) at PSV.]]
The joint contract of Chelsea and PSV loaned Alex to PSV for three years, with Chelsea having a €1 million buy-out clause. Alex eventually played three years at PSV, donning the number 4 jersey for the [[Eindhoven]] club. While playing for PSV, he earned himself the nickname "The Tank" due to his cannonball-like free kicks and his strong physical stature.<ref name=Tank>{{cite web|url=http://www.depers.nl/sport/83093/De-Tank-rolt-naar-Chelsea.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070911223607/http://www.depers.nl/sport/83093/De-Tank-rolt-naar-Chelsea.html |archivedate=11 September 2007 |title=De Tank rolt naar Chelsea |publisher=DePers.nl |date=16 July 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |language=Dutch}}</ref>

He formally joined PSV in the [[2004–05 in Dutch football|2004–05 season]], helping the club win a domestic double of both the [[Eredivisie]] championship and [[Dutch Cup]] that year. In the [[UEFA Champions League 2004-05|Champions League]], Alex played a key role in the PSV team that was eliminated in the semi-finals against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on away  goals (PSV won their home game 3–1 but had previously lost 0–2 at the [[San Siro]]). The team eliminated [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais]] on their way to the semi-finals.

Alex won a second straight Dutch league championship in the [[2005–06 Eredivisie|2005–06 season]] with PSV. Chelsea did not recall Alex, even though [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]] and Chelsea Head of Scouting [[Frank Arnesen]] recommended that Alex be brought over to solve the club's defensive problems.<ref name="times">{{cite news | author=Matt Hughes | title='Special One' has suffered a power cut | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,277-2548077,00.html |archiveurl=http://www.joinmust.org/forum/showthread.php?t=32325 |archivedate=15 January 2007|work=The Times | date=15 January 2007 | accessdate=17 January 2007 | location=London}}</ref> Instead, Chelsea manager [[José Mourinho]] insisted on the signing of [[Khalid Boulahrouz]] in place of Alex.<ref name="times" /> Therefore, Alex stayed a third season at PSV on loan in [[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07]]. He won a third straight Eredivisie title with PSV, after a dramatic final-day finish to the season in which PSV sensationally trumped both [[AFC Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]]. Alex scored in a [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07 knockout stage#First knockout round|UEFA Champions League first knockout round]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for both teams in the second half, turning in an [[own goal]] past his own goalkeeper [[Heurelho Gomes]], but compensating for it with a storming headed goal with eight minutes left to play to redeem himself and in the process ensure PSV a place in the quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite news | title=Arsenal 1–1 PSV (agg 1–2) | work=BBC Football | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6414959.stm | accessdate=9 March 2007  | date=7 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070308101340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6414959.stm| archivedate= 8 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He was later injured, however, and played no part in PSV's [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07 knockout stage#Quarter-finals|UEFA Champions League quarter-final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], which PSV lost 4–0 on aggregate.

====2007–08====
[[File:Alex Makélélé.jpg|thumb|Alex and [[Claude Makélélé]] warming up a for a match against [[Manchester United]] in 2008]]
In an interview with Dutch newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', Alex confirmed that Chelsea were in the process of getting him a work permit and that the possibilities of him joining Chelsea next season were very high.<ref>{{cite web | title=Alex set on Chelsea move| work=[[Sky Sports]] | url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/2454946/alex-set-on-chelsea-move| accessdate=6 July 2014 }}</ref> Alex later confirmed that Chelsea had almost completed the process of acquiring him a work permit and that he would start the season as a Chelsea player.

Alex was granted a work permit on 2 August 2007, and completed his transfer to Chelsea after agreeing to personal terms and passing a medical, where he then signed a three-year deal with the [[London]] club.

On 14 August 2007, Alex was presented to the English media in a press conference with manager [[José Mourinho]], where he was given shirt number 33. He made his debut on 19 August when he came on as a substitute for [[Florent Malouda]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the 85th minute, with the teams tied at 1–1. He also played in the 0–2 defeat away at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and the 4–0 victory over [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Liverpool 1–1 Chelsea|work=BBC SPORT | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/6941876.stm| accessdate=19 August 2007 | date=19 August 2007}}</ref>

====2008–09====
Alex enjoyed his longest spell in the first team during the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 season]]. He was given his chance due to regular starter [[Ricardo Carvalho]] being injured for long periods of the campaign. He scored Chelsea's 1,000th Premier League goal against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 1 November 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7684736.stm|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=1 November 2008}}</ref>  Alex started every game for Chelsea under [[Guus Hiddink]], who managed Alex at [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], and also scored in an [[FA Cup]] quarter-final victory away to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Coventry City 0-2 Chelsea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7910378.stm|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=7 March 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Newcastle vs Chesea 28 Nov 2010 - 4.jpg|thumb|180px|Alex and [[Didier Drogba]] marking [[Newcastle United]]'s [[Andy Carroll]] and [[Shola Ameobi]].]]

In light of Ricardo Carvalho's departure to [[Real Madrid]], Alex started the 2010-11 season as first choice centre back for Chelsea, alongside [[John Terry]]. On 3 October 2010, he scored a 25 yard freekick in a 2–0 victory over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. On 5 October, he was ruled out for up to three weeks after picking up a thigh injury in the final stages of Sunday's 2–0 win over Arsenal, and subsequently withdrew from the Brazil squad for the friendly matches against [[Iran]], and [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9044194.stm |title=

On 1 December 2010, Alex suffered a knee injury and was out of action about 3 months. While rehabilitation on his injury, Manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] would consider signing a new defender if Alex fails to recover from knee surgery before the end of January but Alex failed to do so and Chelsea went on to sign [[David Luiz]] from Benfica.<ref>{{cite news|title=Carlo eyes January buy|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6617821/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=27 December 2010|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> By mid March 2011, Alex made his return to training with the first-team squad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alex set for Chelsea return|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6815022/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=15 March 2011|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>

After he recovered from the injury, Alex made his return on 9 April 2011 in a match against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in a 1-0 win, where he came on for [[Paulo Ferreira]] in the 75th minute. On 8 May 2011, it took a goal-costing mistake from David Luiz against [[Manchester United]] in the season-deciding match for Alex to break back into the starting line-up, getting substituted on at half time that match, and then starting and playing the full 90 minutes the following match against [[Newcastle United]] at Stamford Bridge on 15 May 2011, where he scored a headed goal in the 82nd minute in a 2–2 draw. In the last league game of the season against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Alex started the match alongside [[John Terry]] but was substituted on 70 minutes for Ferreira in their 1–0 defeat at [[Goodison Park]]. At the end of the campaign, Alex made 20 appearances and scored 2 goals in all competitions. Alex was criticized for allegedly stating in an interview that he was a boyhood Liverpool supporter.

====2011–12====
In the summer transfer window, Alex was the subject of a bid from [[Arsenal F.C.-Chelsea F.C. rivalry|local rivals]] [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal eyeing Alex|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/7137378/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> On 20 August 2011, in a home game against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], a defensive mistake from Alex allowed striker [[Shane Long]] through to score four minutes into the game. In the end, however, Chelsea won 2–1. On 21 September 2011, in a League Cup tie against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], Alex received a straight red card in the 49th minute after a foul on [[Kerim Frei]], which also resulted a penalty. [[Pajtim Kasami]], however, missed Fulham's penalty after his kick was saved by back-up goalkeeper [[Ross Turnbull]].

[[File:Alex Rodrigo Dias da Costa (PSG).JPG|thumb|Alex warming up with Paris Saint-Germain]]

On his move, he publicly stated that the reason for it was that [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] manager [[André Villas-Boas]] had not given him enough playing time at the club.<ref>{{cite news|title=Alex completes move to PSG as defender ends Stamford Bridge misery|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2092692/Alex-completes-PSG-Chelsea.html|work=Daily Mail |date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012}}</ref> He was given the number 13 shirt, free since the departure of [[Sammy Traoré]].

On 12 February 2012, Alex made his debut for PSG in a 0–0 draw against [[OGC Nice|Nice]], where he made his first start before coming off for [[Christophe Jallet]] at half-time. The following week, on 19 February 2012, Alex scored a 30-yard goal from a lay-off free kick, his first goal for PSG, against Montpellier on a free-kick combination with compatriot [[Nenê (footballer born 1981)|Nenê]], which the result was 2–2. On 8 April 2012, Alex scored the winning goal in the 61st minute in a 2–1 win over [[Olympique de Marseille]]. On 6 November 2012, in a Champions League match against [[Dinamo Zagreb]], Alex scored the first goal of the match, a  half-volley that evaded the reach of Dinamo goalkeeper [[Ivan Kelava]] after 16 minutes.

On 3 August 2013, Alex scored the game-winning goal with the last kick of the game in PSG's 2–1 defeat of [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in the [[2013 Trophée des Champions|Trophée des Champions]] at the [[Stade d'Angondjé]] in [[Libreville]], [[Gabon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1513330/paris-saint-germain-beat-bordeaux-trophee-des-champions?cc=5901 |title=Blanc wins first trophy with PSG |publisher=ESPNFC |date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013 }}</ref>

==International career==
Alex made his debut for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 17 July 2003 against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. Although he played under [[Brazil Olympic football team|Brazil U-23 team]] at the tournament, the tournament was a full international tournament, hence the international cap gained was fully recognized by [[FIFA]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Futebol – The Foreign Legion| work=ofutebol.com | url=http://alexbellos.com/fl_country.asp?id=137| accessdate=20 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927091950/http://alexbellos.com/fl_country.asp?id=137 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref>

He was overlooked for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] squad. However, after the World Cup, he earned regular call-ups with the new head coach, [[Dunga]]. He was a member of the Brazil squad that won the [[2007 Copa América]] with a 3–0 victory over arch-rivals [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the final. He was dropped from the Brazilian squad for the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] due to injuries.

On 11 May, he was called up to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] squad as one of the seven back-up players.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbf.com.br/php/noticias.php?e=29&n=11190|title=Comissão técnica da Seleção Brasileira divulga a lista complementar enviada à FIFA|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=12 May 2010|work=CBF.com.br|language=Portuguese| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100515030023/http://www.cbf.com.br/php/noticias.php?e=29&n=11190| archivedate= 15 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

'''Graham Alexander''' (born 10 October 1971) is a former professional [[Association football|footballer]]. He is the manager of [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].

For most of his career, [[Coventry]]-born Alexander played as a specialist at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]], but was also deployed in [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfield]],<ref name=autogenerated2>
[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1102381,00.html Alexander The Seventh! | Burnley | News | Latest Headlines | Latest Headlines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as he did early on in his career with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]]. He is the fourth oldest player to score in [[Premier League]] history.<ref>[http://www.statbunker.com/football/ktg/index.php?PL=ktgalltime&Code=EPL&statType=oldest_gs]</ref> He was also a [[penalty kick]] specialist. On 16 April 2011, in Burnley's win over [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in a Championship match, Alexander became only the second outfield player in English football history to have made 1,000 professional appearances, after [[Tony Ford (footballer born 1959)|Tony Ford]].<ref name="1000th game">{{cite web|title=Burnley 2-1 Swansea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13022994.stm  |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref> He is fifth on the [[list of footballers in England and Scotland by number of league appearances]]. He won the 2013/14 League 1 Playoffs as manager of Fleetwood Town.

==Club career==
Alexander began his career in the late 1980s as a [[youth team|youth player]] with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He made his first-team debut on 27 April 1991, coming on as a substitute for [[Mark Hine]], and signed his first professional contract the same year. In [[1991-92 in English football|1991–92]], he established himself as a member of Scunthorpe's first team, usually playing at right back.

===Luton Town===
Alexander made over 200 appearances at Scunthorpe before moving to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for a transfer fee of £100,000.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/2151067.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alexander eyes Iron tie | date=2002-07-25 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=87 www.soccerbase.com – The Internet Soccer Database<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He went on to make a similar number of appearances with Luton in his four years with the club.

===Preston North End===
In 1999 two clubs were vying for his signature; [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. Both clubs made offers for the player but Alexander opted for a move to Preston.<ref>[http://www.clarets-mad.co.uk/news/loadnews.asp?cid=TMNW&id=350838 Graham Alexander is finally a Dingle – Burnley FC – Clarets MAD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He became a first team regular at [[Deepdale]], eventually club captain and an established set-piece taker, particularly in [[penalty kick|penalties]].<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.burnleyfootballclub.premiumtv.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10413~8811,00.html Graham Alexander | Burnley | Team | Profiles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Alexander stayed remarkably fit during his career, hardly ever suffering a major injury. However, during the [[2000-01 in English football|2000–01]] season, Alexander missed several weeks of the season after breaking his [[ribs|rib]] in an away match against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/1090991.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alexander injury blow for Preston | date=2000-12-28 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> During his eight years at Preston, Alexander made exactly 400 appearances for the club, with his 400th and final match coming against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester]] on 25 August 2007.<ref>[http://www.pnefc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10362~1098579,00.html 400 Up For Grezza | Preston North End | News | Latest | Latest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was also in the PFA's Championship Team of the Season for [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]]<ref name=autogenerated3 /> 

During the summer of 2007 a number of clubs were linked with Alexander including [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] who had a £50,000 bid turned down by Preston, who said;
<blockquote>
"He is club captain and a vital member of this squad and certainly not a player we will allow to leave."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/5221206.stm | work=BBC News | title=Preston reject bid for Alexander | date=2006-07-27 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>
</blockquote>

===Burnley===
On 29 August 2007, he made a surprise move to local rivals [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] almost nine years after they had originally tried to sign him. The reasons cited for his departure were that Preston would not extend his contract by another year,<ref>[http://www.pnefc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10362~1103387,00.html Grezza's Emotional Farewell | Preston North End | News | Latest | Latest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> so when offered a two-year contract by Burnley the player accepted and made a £200,000 move to [[Turf Moor]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/6970677.stm | work=BBC News | title=Burnley recruit PNE's Alexander | date=2007-08-31 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> Preston [[Chairman]] [[Derek Shaw (businessman)|Derek Shaw]] did not want to lose the player and said;

<blockquote>
"We don't particularly want to sell Graham but he has the comfort of a two-year contract at Burnley whereas he only has one year here at Deepdale. We quite possibly would have renewed Graham's contract, he's a fit man." <ref name=autogenerated5 /><ref>http://www.lep.co.uk/WebPartsTpls/sport?articleid=3161836</ref>
</blockquote>

The £200,000 transfer money was made up of £100,000 payable in 2007 and the final £100,000 payable in the summer of 2008.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In Burnley's promotion season in 2008–09 Alexander at the age of 37 played in all of Burnleys 61 League and Cup games that season ending with the 1–0 Play-Off final victory over Sheffield United at Wembley which took Burnley back to the Top Flight of English Football for the first time in 33 years.

On 29 June 2009, Alexander signed a new one-year contract at Burnley,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/8123860.stm|title=Alexander pens new Burnley deal |date=2009-06-29|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> and on 15 August he became the oldest player to make a Premier League debut. On 19 September, Alexander scored his first Premier League goal, a penalty, in a 3–1 win at home to [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Burnley 3–1 Sunderland |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8255397.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=19 September 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2009 }}</ref> On 31 October 2009, Alexander scored both goals in a 2–0 home win against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Burnley 2–0 Hull |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8333572.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=31 October 2009 |first=Oliver |last=Brett}}</ref> A week later he then scored the first for Burnley, from the spot, at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in a thrilling 3–3 draw.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man City 3–3 Burnley |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8342972.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009 }}</ref> On 16 December, he scored his 100th league goal. He scored an equaliser against Arsenal, sending ''Gunners'' 'keeper [[Manuel Almunia]] the wrong way. On 10 April 2010, Alexander again scored twice against Hull City – both penalties – in a 4–1 win to take his tally for the season to eight, seven of which have been penalties. Alexander takes penalties in an unusual way, opting to use the outside of his foot rather than the inside. On 6 May 2010 he was named Burnley's Player of the year for the 2009–10 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Burnley Player of the Year Awards  |url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2044757,00.html |work=www.burnleyfootballclub.com |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}</ref> He is among the oldest players ever to score in the Premier League.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1249463/Goal-den-oldies-Kevin-Phillips-latest-Premier-League-veteran-hit-net.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Clare | last=Martin | title=Goal-den oldies: Kevin Phillips becomes the latest Premier League veteran to hit the net | date=9 February 2010}}</ref>

On 5 August 2010 Burnley's First Team Manager, [[Brian Laws]], officially named the 38-year-old as club captain for the 2010–11 season.<ref name="burnleyfootballclub.com">http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2111901,00.html</ref> On Alexander's appointment, Laws said "Graham is the consummate professional who has been instrumental in the success that this club has seen in the past few seasons, so it was an easy choice" <ref name="burnleyfootballclub.com"/>

In April 2011, Alexander made his 1,000th senior appearance for club and country in a 2–1 win against [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] as an 87th minute substitute.<ref name="1000th game"/> Only [[Tony Ford (footballer born 1959)|Tony Ford]] has matched this feat as an outfield player.<ref name="1000th game"/> At the end of the season, Alexander looked likely to leave [[Turf Moor]], as he was linked with managerial jobs with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]], but Burnley boss [[Eddie Howe]] stated that he was still part of his plans for the following season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Burnley captain Graham Alexander to stay at Turf Moor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/burnley/9522169.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=24 June 2011}}</ref> On 4 July 2011, Alexander was released by Burnley.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander Leaves Turf Moor|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~2386010,00.html|publisher=Burnley Football Club|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>

===Return to Preston North End===
Alexander returned to [[Preston North End]] on 3 August 2011, as he signed a one-year contract with the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14392301.stm|title=Graham Alexander re-joins Preston North End|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> He was given the number 22 and made his debut against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].

Alexander scored his first goal for Preston in 4 years with a trademark penalty in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere on 24 September 2011.<ref>{{cite news

He was the third Preston player to take a penalty in this shootout, and he blazed it over the bar, much to the disbelief of the fans. Preston's next penalty-taker, [[Paul Coutts]], had his penalty saved, and then when the next penalty was scored by Chesterfield's [[Alexandre Mendy]], Preston got knocked out of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news

|date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> after which Alexander did not feature for the Lilywhites for a long time, and there was speculation that he had played his last game for Preston, and in his career.

After the sacking of Phil Brown a few games down the line, he became joint-caretaker manager, alongside David Unsworth. His first match in joint-charge was an away match against MK Dons, which they won 1–0. Just before what was to be an ordinary match against Wycombe Wanderers, it was announced that Graham Westley would replace them at the helm of Preston, and that Wycombe was to be the last match in charge for the pairing of Alexander and Unsworth. They won the match 3–2, and left a good base for Westley to build on.

Playing his final game on 28 April 2012 against [[Charlton Athletic F.C|Charlton Athletic]], Alexander came on as a substitute for [[Max Ehmer]] in the 84th minute. This was supposed to be a cameo appearance to allow the Preston supporters to show their appreciation of his service to the club. However, with Preston losing 1–2 in stoppage time, they were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from Charlton's goal. Alexander stepped up to curl the ball around the wall and inside the near post, scoring with the very last kick of his career.<ref>{{cite news

|title=Preston   2 - 2   Charlton
|publisher=BBC
|date=28 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref>

On 20 June 2012, Alexander was appointed Head of Youth Development.  Chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] said "He's got over 1,000 games under his belt, he's a hero here and what better person to head our youth development." <ref>{{cite news

'''Jérémie Aliadière''' (born 30 March 1983) is a [[France|French]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Umm Salal SC|Umm Salal]].

As a graduate of the elite [[Clairefontaine]] academy, he signed for Arsenal aged 16. After making his Premier League debut in the [[2001–02 in English football|2001–02]] season, he ultimately had limited opportunities, partly due to injury. For the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season he was loaned to three clubs, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[Scottish Premier League]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the Premier League, and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the [[Football League Championship]], before returning to Arsenal for another season, featuring in the [[2007 Football League Cup Final]] loss to Chelsea. At the beginning of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season he was sold to Premier League club Middlesbrough for £2.5 million, where he spent the next three seasons, two in the Premier League and the last in the Championship, before electing not to extend his contract and leaving the club in June 2010.

== Club career ==

=== Arsenal ===
Aliadière signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at the age of 16 before the beginning of the [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]] season. 
He made his Premiership debut for Arsenal against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02 season]], replacing [[Thierry Henry]] in a 4–1 victory. That game was his only league appearance that season, meaning he wasn't eligible for a medal as Arsenal won the [[2001-02 FA Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Games played by Jeremie Aliadiere in 2001/2002|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=28839&season_id=131|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> He scored his first goal for the club the following season, in a 5–2 victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 27 August 2002.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2216506.stm | title=Slick Arsenal crush Baggies | publisher=BBC Sport | date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref>

In the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season, Aliadière was mainly played in the [[2003–04 Football League Cup|2003–04 League Cup]] rather than the league, scoring Arsenal's first League Cup goal of the season against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]. The match finished 1–1 after extra time, with Arsenal winning 9–8 on penalties.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3204793.stm | title=Arsenal 1–1 Rotherham | publisher=BBC Sport | date=28 October 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> He also scored twice against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the following round of the League Cup,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3246940.stm | title=Arsenal youngsters thump Wolves | publisher=BBC Sport | date=2 December 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> his second winning goal for the month for December. In total he scored four goals in the cup run, having also scored against West Brom in the quarter finals, with Arsenal finally being eliminated by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3314305.stm | title=Arsenal outgun Baggies | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 December 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> He was voted best young talent in the 2003–04 League Cup.<ref>[http://www.carlingcup.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,11995~611622,00.html  Rising Stars]. Retrieved 1 December 2007 {{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> As the season went on, he made further inroads into the Arsenal first team, playing 10 Premier League matches, seven as a substitute, to gain a Premier League winners' medal, as well as making his [[FA Cup]] debut in a 1–0 defeat against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the semi finals. He also came on as a late substitute in Arsenal's 5-1 victory over [[Inter Milan]] in the [[San Siro]]. Seconds after coming on he set up the 5th goal for [[Robert Pires]].<ref>{{cite web

Aliadière missed much of the following [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season through injury, and was kept out of action until February. On his return, he made six substitute appearances for the first team. Although he failed to score in these matches, he scored eight goals in five games for Arsenal's reserves. Despite his limited opportunities, he was offered and signed a new Arsenal contract, running until the summer of 2009, announced at the same time as a loan move to Celtic.<ref>{{cite news|title=New deal for Aliadiere|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/2339962/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 June 2005|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Loan to Celtic ===
In the summer of 2005, Aliadière was sent on loan to Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], for the entire [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]] season, in order to play regular first team football. Despite his limited appearances, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had stated he had a future at Arsenal, despite being kept out of the side at the time by the form of [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Dennis Bergkamp]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Aliadiere signs on at Celtic Park|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4625607.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 July 2005|accessdate=25 November 2007}}</ref> In the end, his time at Celtic was forgettable; he made just two substitute appearances for the club, one in each leg of their loss to [[FC Petržalka 1898|Artmedia Bratislava]] in the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. He accused Celtic manager [[Gordon Strachan]] of not giving him a chance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11685/2346045/|title=Aliadiere slams Strachan|publisher=Sky Sports|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Loan to West Ham United ===
On 24 August 2005, Aliadière decided to move back to London after a lack of first team opportunities, where [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] took over his year-long loan deal, having been promoted back to the Premier League after two seasons in the lower leagues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aliadiere leaves Celtic, joins Hammers on loan|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=340400&cc=5739|publisher=Soccernet.epsn.go.com|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref>  Once again affected by injury, he only made eight appearances for West Ham, seven as a substitute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeremy Aliadiere|url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=819&united=Jeremie_Aliadiere|publisher=westhamstats.info|accessdate=2 April 2012}}</ref>

=== Loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
On 31 January 2006, West Ham terminated the loan, and Aliadière moved to the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] to join the [[Football League Championship]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on loan for the remainder of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season. He scored two league goals for Wolves, in games against Hull<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4727024.stm | title=Hull 2–3 Wolves | publisher=BBC Sport | date=25 February 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4890832.stm | title=Wolves 1–1 Watford | publisher=BBC Sport | date=14 April 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> At the end of the season he returned to Arsenal.

=== Return to Arsenal ===
Having returned to Arsenal, during the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season Aliadière was again mainly used in the [[2006–07 Football League Cup]] campaign, scoring both goals in their 2–0 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 24 October 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6072672.stm | title=West Brom 0–2 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=24 October 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> His first Premier League goal of the season came on 16 December 2006, a 2–2 draw against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], with Aliadière playing for 70 minutes before being replaced by [[Robin Van Persie]]. Continuing appearances in Arsenal's League Cup campaign saw him score in the quarter-final against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in a 6–3 victory, and in the second leg of the semi-final against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with Arsenal advancing with a 3–1 win.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6236687.stm | title=Liverpool 3–6 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=9 January 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Sam | last=Lyon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6305313.stm | title=Arsenal 3–1 Tottenham (agg 5–3) | publisher=BBC Sport | date=31 January 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Sam | last=Lyon}}</ref> Arsenal ultimately lost [[2007 Football League Cup Final|the final]] 2–1 to Chelsea, with Aliadière featuring for 80 minutes.

With four appearances in Premier League matches during the season; as of 9 January 2007 he had played 37 times for Arsenal, 25 as a substitute, scoring nine goals, all but one coming in the League Cup, four against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. In the January 2007 transfer window, Aliadière was linked with a move to the Premier League club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in North East England, after Wenger said he would be allowed to leave the club. The move failed to happen however, after [[Robin van Persie]] broke his foot, and he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2006–07 season against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a 0–0 draw at [[Fratton Park]].

=== Middlesbrough ===
[[File:Jérémie Aliadière 18-10-2008 1.jpg|thumb|Aliadière playing for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 2008]]
Middlesbrough signed Aliadière on 19 June 2007, for an initial fee of £2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Aliadiere completes Boro switch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/6736685.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 June 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> He scored his first goal in a Premier League match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]] in October 2007, with a header to draw level at 1–1, before Middlesbrough went on to lose the game 4–1.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd 4–1 Middlesbrough |first=Ian |last=Hughes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7054065.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> This was his first Premier League goal, since scoring his first ever for Arsenal on 27 August 2002.

Aliadière got a red card and three match ban for slapping [[Javier Mascherano]]  in a 23 February 2008 Premier League match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], after Mascherano had raised his hands against him, in full view of the referee. It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as "frivolous" by [[the Football Association]] (FA) and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager [[Harry Redknapp]], deeming this unfair and criticising the FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's [[Michael Essien]].<ref name="Lamb Slaughters FA">{{cite news | title = Lamb Slaughters FA | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_3200633,00.html | publisher = Sky Sports | date = 27 February 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-27}}</ref><ref name="Gibson rages at FA over appeal">{{cite news | title = Gibson rages at FA over appeal | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/7263735.stm | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 28 February 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-28}}</ref><ref name="Harry Slams Appeals Process">{{cite news | title = Harry Slams Appeals Process | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_3210265,00.html | publisher = Sky Sports | date = 28 February 2008 | accessdate = 2008-02-28}}</ref>

Before the start of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season, Aliadière switched to wearing the number 10 previously worn by midfielder [[Fábio Rochemback]], when his number 11 was given to 3.2 million summer signing [[Marvin Emnes]]. He scored his first goal of the season in Middlesbrough's 5–1 home victory against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 26 August 2008. His first Premier League goal of the season came in a 1–0 win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the [[JJB Stadium]] on 4 October 2008, scoring in the 89th minute of the match. After a run of not scoring in his next ten matches, he again scored against his old club Arsenal, with a headed equaliser in a home 1–1 draw on 13 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7763484.stm | title=Middlesbrough 1–1 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=13 December 2008 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}</ref> At the end of the season, Middlesbrough finished equal bottom of the Premier League with West Brom, on 32 points, and as a result were relegated to the [[Football League Championship]].

On 12 September 2009, he came off the bench against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] to score two goals after 30 minutes of being on the pitch, and scored another goal in the same week against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. His next goal came on 26 December against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], in his first start under new manager [[Gordon Strachan]] due to injury. Having failed to reach the play-offs, and after three injury hit seasons at Middlesbrough, he left the club on 30 June 2010 at the end of his contract having decided not to take up the option of extending his contract. In total he had made 86 appearances, scoring 12 goals, for the club.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/8664874.stm | title=Jeremie Aliadiere set for Middlesbrough exit – Strachan | publisher=BBC Sport | date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> 2010–11 pre-season found Aliadière training with West Ham with a view to a permanent move to the London club. The deal fell through when he damaged his knee ligaments playing in a reserve game against Crystal Palace.

In January 2011, Aliadiere also revealed he was linked with a move to [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] but the move collapsed over contract issues; he described the experience as hitting 'rock-bottom'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nightmare for Aliadiere|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/6914372/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=5 May 2011|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]], a club based in the [[United Arab Emirates]], announced on 13 February 2011 that they had signed Aliadiere,<ref>{{cite news|title=The French striker Jérémie Aliadière joins Al Ain Club|url=http://www.alainfc.net/en/index.php?p=shownews&nid=2240|publisher=alainfc.net|date=13 February 2011|accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> but he subsequently denounced their claim, stating that he had rejected a move and Al Ain had "been very unprofessional in their conduct".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6754114,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Aliadiere rejects Al Ain move}}</ref>

'''Hasney Aljofree''' (born 11 July 1978) is a former English [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]].

He began his career with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], during which time he earned one cap for the [[England national under-18 football team|England U18]] side. He joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 1996 and made his first-team debut the following year. Aljofree moved on to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in 2000 and spent a productive two years with the club, scoring his first four goals in league competition. He linked up with [[Paul Sturrock]] for a second time at [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], where he enjoyed the most successful period of his career to date. Having gained his first league winners medal in 2004, Aljofree played an important role in re-establishing the club in the second tier of [[Football in England|English football]]. He spent time on loan with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] before being signed by [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]]; linking up with Sturrock for a fourth time.

Aljofree [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the side on numerous occasions, but was also hampered by injury problems, one of which kept him sidelined for 10 months. He was released from his contract in 2010 and then signed for Oldham Athletic on a short-term contract.

==Early career==
Aljofree started his career as a youth player with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], a move to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in July 1996. He made 22 first-team appearances for Bolton, scoring three goals, before being transferred in 2000 to [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/810130.stm|title=Duo arrive at Tannadice|date=28 June 2000|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> who were managed at the time by [[Paul Sturrock]]. Aljofree scored his first goal in his fourth match for the club, netting in a 2–1 defeat to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], and he scored again in December, again in a defeat. Established as a first-team regular, Aljofree scored five times in the [[2001–02 in Scottish football|2001–02 season]], finishing on the winning side every time. After starting one match at the beginning of the following season, Aljofree was released from [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?tm=3&nID=1101&cd=2002&cd1=8|title=Hasney departs Tannadice|date=30 August 2002|publisher=Dundee United FC|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> subsequently moving to by English [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], now managed by Sturrock.

==Plymouth Argyle==
During the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05 season]], he moved on loan to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], again managed by Sturrock, and many thought that the manager would sign Aljofree again permanently.{{fact|date=January 2015}} After just two appearances for Wednesday, he picked up an injury and returned to Argyle. Following the injury, he continued to make regular starts for Plymouth Argyle and captained the side during a pre-season friendly against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 2006. He appeared to have picked up a serious injury after 31 minutes of an away game against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 16 September 2006 and left the field on a stretcher with a neck brace. It was soon announced that he had been taken to hospital, and announced that he had suffered no injury at all.

In January 2007, Aljofree caused controversy with a goal celebration after scoring in a [[2006–07 FA Cup]] match at [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]]. After celebrating in front of the opposing fans, bottles were thrown at the player, prompting a police investigation. Aljofree made a written apology to Peterborough fans, which was displayed on the club's official website,<ref>{{cite news |title=Police probe Aljofree celebration |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/6245537.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2008 }}</ref> with then-Plymouth manager [[Ian Holloway]] saying, "To celebrate like that was a disgrace and I would have thrown a bottle at him myself."<ref>{{cite news |title=Peterborough 1–1 Plymouth |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6213935.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>

==Swindon Town==
Aljofree had his fourth spell with manager [[Paul Sturrock]] by signing for Swindon Town in 2007,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/6228150.stm|title=Swindon bag Plymouth's Aljofree|date=21 June 2007|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> although Sturrock left for his former club, Plymouth Argyle, in November 2007, after naming Aljofree as Swindon's captain for the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/6922768.stm|title=Aljofree handed Swindon captaincy |date=30 July 2007|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref> Under the management of [[Maurice Malpas]] he retained the captaincy.

As Malpas' Swindon team struggled at the wrong end of the table, Aljofree performances followed suit as he received criticism from the fans ofa lack of leadership and under-par performances. Aljofree hit back publicly by telling the Swindon Advertiser that the felt the players were "scared to play at the [[County Ground, Swindon|County Ground]]",<ref>[http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/2454497.we_are_scared_to_play_here/ 'We are scared to play here']</ref> a statement that received widespread ridicule from the Swindon faithful, as they expected results to turn around.

A month later, Aljofree captained the Swindon team to a 1–0 defeat at [[Conference National|Conference]] side [[Histon F.C.|Histon]] in the [[FA Cup]],<ref>[http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/3831130.FULL_TIME__Histon_1_Town_0/?action=complain&cid=7333021 FULL TIME: Histon 1 Town 0]</ref> with an ankle injury keeping him out of the next two games, by which time Maurice Malpas had been given the sack. Aljofree is yet to play under current manager [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] as a knee injury forced him off in a relegation battle with [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil]], a week prior to Wilson's arrival on Boxing Day. The knee injury was expected to keep him out of the festive period only, however, in early January, Aljofree underwent surgery on the injury, extending his layoff for another 5 weeks. To add insult to injury, during his five-week recovery period it was announced he would have to have another operation, keeping him out for the remainder of the season.

On 20 October 2009, Aljofree made a return to football, playing 45 minutes for Swindon Reserves in a match against his old side [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]], after 10 months out of action. However, with stiff competition for defensive roles at the club, Aljofree has accepted that he may need to head out [[Loan (association football)|on loan]] to regain full recovery.<ref>[http://www.thisisswindontownfc.co.uk/news/4693344.Hasney_returns_from__touch_and_go__injury/ Hasney returns from 'touch and go' injury]</ref>

On 1 February 2010, Aljofree's tenure with Swindon Town came to an end as it was announced that the player had left the club after both the player and club agreed to terminate his contract.<ref>[http://www.swindontownfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10341~1932282,00.html Aljofree Allowed To Seek Pastures New]</ref>

==Return to Oldham==
On 3 February 2010, Aljofree signed a pay-as-you-play contract with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] until the end of the 2009–10 season.<ref>[http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk/news-features/10/oldham-athletic-news/36230/latics-sign-free-agent-aljofree Latics sign free agent Aljofree]</ref> He was released after the 3–0 defeat to Yeovil, his only start in an Oldham shirt.<ref>[http://www.oldhamathletic.co.uk/page/NewsUpdate/0,,10337~2043706,00.html]</ref>

He returned to Oldham for a third time in November 2010 as a coach for the under-14 side, having been forced to retire from the playing side of the game after a 14-year career.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11730_6496810,00.html Aljofree returns to Oldham]</ref>

He is currently the coach of [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton's]] U17 side.

==Playing career==
Allan or "Swan neck" was born in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], [[Scotland]] and started his professional career at [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], where he made only five appearances. After just one year at the club he was sold to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] of the [[FA Premier League|English Premiership]] for a fee of £75,000 in March 1993.

Southampton's manager [[Ian Branfoot]] saw Allan as "one for the future" but a series of injuries restricted him to just one premiership appearance when he came on as a late substitute for [[Matthew Bound]] in a 1–0 defeat at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 1 May 1993.<ref name ="ITN">{{cite book | author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk | title=In That Number - A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC  | publisher=Hagiology Publishing | year=2003|pages=227 & 472|isbn=0-9534474-3-X}}</ref>

In March 2014 [[Jimmy Case]] took him on loan to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]], before making the move permanent. In the three years he spent at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] he made 67 league appearances, scoring twice. Allan joined non-league side [[Kingstonian F.C.|Kingstonian]] and was player of the season in the [[1999-00 in English football|1999–00 season]]. Allan had a successful spell at Kingsmeadow, being part of the winning 2000 FA Trophy squad beating Kettering Town 3-2 in a dramatic Wembley Final. 68 appearances in 2 seasons <ref name ="ITN"/>

In July 2001 he was signed by [[Scotland|Scottish]] side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. His stay was again hampered by injuries<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.qosfc.com/profile034.htm| title=Queen of the South Squad Details 2003/2004 | publisher=www.qosfc.com| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070305180440/http://www.qosfc.com/profile034.htm |archivedate=5 March 2007}}</ref> and he was limited to just 47 league appearances. Allan spent the last season of his career at [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]], before early retirement at the age of just 30.

Derek is now the Elite Youth Coach at Greenock Morton Under 17s and a fully UEFA Qualified 'A' licence Youth Coach.

He is a well-travelled [[Forward (association football)|striker]] known for his sharp finishing ability

==Club career==
Allbäck started his professional career with [[Örgryte IS]]. He then proceeded to have two modest stints abroad, with [[Lyngby Boldklub]] and [[A.S. Bari]] of [[Serie A]], before rejoining his first club.

In 2000 he joined [[SC Heerenveen]] of the [[Eredivisie]], before moving to [[Aston Villa]] for £2 million in 2002. He was not a regular for the [[Premier League]] club, due to [[Darius Vassell]] and [[Juan Pablo Ángel]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11677/2303690/ | title = Italians eye Villa marksman | publisher = Sky Sports | accessdate = 29 April 2014 | first = Nadia | last = Carminati }}</ref> At the end of his contract, he joined [[Hansa Rostock]] in summer 2004.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=220176.html | title = Hansa snap up Allbäck | publisher = UEFA.com | date = 28 August 2004 | accessdate = 29 April 2014}}</ref>

In the summer of 2005, aged 32, Allbäck signed with [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. On 1 November 2006, he scored their first goal ever in the [[UEFA Champions League]] – a winner against two-times competition winners [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/nov/02/match.sport1 | title = Allback goal leaves United stuck in muddy misery | publisher = The Guardian | date = 2 November 2006 | accessdate = 29 April 2014 | first = Daniel | last = Taylor}}</ref> In that match, he was also awarded the fans' Man of the Match award. 20 days later he also scored against [[S.L. Benfica]] at [[Estádio da Luz]] – a match lost 3–1. Allbäck scored again in the last group stage match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at Parken in a 3–1 win. After the final home game of the [[Danish Superliga 2006–07]] season, he was presented with the fans' Player of the Year award, as the side emerged back-to-back champions, and the striker netted 11 league goals.

In August 2007, Allbäck scored a late away equaliser against [[Beitar Jerusalem]] in the second leg of the second round Champions League qualifier in [[extra time]], to keep Copenhagen's group stage dreams alive, although the side would eventually bow out to Benfica in the next round.

On 1 July 2008, Allbäck returned to Sweden and Örgryte, his third spell at the club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fotbollskanalen.se/fotbollskanalen/landslag/629097.html | title = Allbäck: Öis är klubben i mitt hjärta  | publisher = Fotbollskanalen.se | language = Swedish | accessdate = 21 February 2010}}</ref>

On 14 December 2009, after [[Örgryte IS]] was relegated from [[Allsvenskan]], Allbäck announced his retirement from football.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fotbolldirekt.com/allb%C3%A4ck-l%C3%A4gger-karri%C3%A4ren-p%C3%A5?page=1211 | title =  Allbäck: "Lägger karriären på is" | publisher = fotbolldirekt.se | language = Swedish | accessdate = 14 January 2012}}</ref>

After Sweden's victory against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], it was official that Allbäck would participate in Örgryte's next home game against Motala, He came on in the 69th minute but could not affect the game in any way.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fotboll.ois.se/9213/Nyhet.aspx | title = Från kostym till kortärma | publisher = fotboll.ois.se | language = Swedish | accessdate = 14 January 2012 | date = 14 October 2011}}</ref>

==International career==
Allbäck played for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] at [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], totalling 74 [[cap (sport)|caps]] with 30 goals. He made his debut for the national side on 27 November 1999 in a friendly against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].

On 20 June 2006 during the 2006 World Cup, Allbäck helped Sweden earn a 2–2 draw against [[England national football team|England]] by netting their first goal. This goal by Allbäck was the 2,000th goal scored in the history of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. On 6 September, he scored twice to help propel Sweden past visitors [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] 3–1 in the second of their [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship qualifying|2008 European Championship qualifying]] matches.

On 6 June 2007, during [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Euro 2008 qualifiers]], Allbäck scored a highly [[Surrealism|surreal]] goal against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] when an opponent, [[Ívar Ingimarsson]], gave him the ball incorrectly thinking a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] had been awarded.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=WoVmuq9FNKY | title = Marcus Allback, Sweden vs. Iceland 5:0, 06–06–07 | work = Youtube | accessdate = 21 February 2010}}</ref>

After Sweden's group stage exit from Euro 2008 (in which he played as a second-half substitute against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in [[Innsbruck]]), Allbäck announced that he would retire from the national team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/svttext/web/pages/303.html|title=Here is the first blueyellow to retire|date= 19 June 2008 |accessdate= 19 June 2008|publisher=SVT.se}} {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref>

As a player, Allen played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1988 to 2004, making [[Premier League]] appearances for both [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He also made [[The Football League|Football League]] appearances for [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. He represented [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level, earning eight caps and scoring two goals.

==Club career==

===Queens Park Rangers===
Born in [[Harold Wood]], London, Allen began his career with [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], where he signed professionally in 1988 during the tenure of [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]], although Smith was replaced by [[Trevor Francis]] mid-way through Allen's first professional season.<ref name="WWCU"/> Over the coming years, he went from strength to strength and began to see regular runs in the first-team. During the inaugural [[Premier League]] season in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93 season]], Allen played six times and scored twice, once in a 1–1 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in January 1993 and the winner during a 2–1 win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Loftus Road]] in May 1993.<ref name="SB9293">{{cite web |title=Bradley Allen – Football Stats – Season 1992/1993 – Soccer Base |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=104&season_id=122 |publisher=Soccerbase |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> On 20 November 1993, he scored a [[List of Premier League hat-tricks|hat-trick]] in a 3–0 win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Houston |first=Bob |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-everton-lose-dignity-1505673.html |title=Everton lose dignity |date=21 November 1993 |accessdate=18 July 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London}}</ref>

Allen was eventually placed on the transfer list during the ill-fated [[1995–96 FA Premier League|1995–96 season]] in which Rangers were relegated. In total, Allen scored 27 goals in 81 league games for QPR.<ref name="NB">{{cite web |title=BRADLEY ALLEN |url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player1/bradleyallen.html |publisher=Post War English & Scottish Football League A – Z Player's Database |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic===
[[Football League First Division|First Division]] [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] paid £400,000 for Allen's services in March 1996.<ref name="WWCU"/> He scored six goals in 21 appearances in the league and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in his first full season with the club<ref name="SB9697">{{cite web |title=Bradley Allen – Football Stats – Season 1996/1997 – Soccer Base |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=104&season_id=126 |publisher=Soccerbase |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> but chances became harder to come by for Allen, as he made only 14 first-team appearances and could net only two goals during the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98 season]] as Charlton were promoted to the Premier League.<ref name="SB9798">{{cite web |title=Bradley Allen – Football Stats – Season 1997/1998 – Soccer Base |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=104&season_id=127 |publisher=Soccerbase |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> He then made only one appearance for the club in the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]],<ref name="SB9899">{{cite web |title=Bradley Allen – Football Stats – Season 1998/1999 – Soccer Base |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=104&season_id=128 |publisher=Soccerbase |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> and then joined [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] side [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] in February 1999.<ref name="WWCU"/> This spelt the end of his time with Charlton, having scored nine goals in 40 league appearances.<ref name="NB"/>

====Colchester United loan====
Recruited by Colchester manager [[Mick Wadsworth]],<ref name="WWCU"/> Allen made his debut for the U's in a 1–1 home draw with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 27 February 1999, before being replaced by [[Steve Forbes (footballer)|Steve Forbes]] after 68 minutes.<ref name="CU debut">{{cite web |title=Colchester United – Match details – Colchester Utd 1–1 Reading |url=http://coludata.co.uk/matchdetails.asp?mid=2889 |publisher=Coludata.co.uk |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> He scored one goal while on loan with the club, a 40th minute equaliser during a 2–2 draw with [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 9 March.<ref name="CU goal">{{cite web |title=Colchester United – Match details – Colchester Utd 2–2 Oldham Athletic |url=http://coludata.co.uk/matchdetails.asp?mid=2891 |publisher=Coludata.co.uk |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> Allen made four appearances in total during his short stay at [[Layer Road]].<ref name="NB"/>

===Redbridge===
Following his release from Hornchurch, Allen quickly joined [[Conference South]] side [[Redbridge F.C.|Ford United]], who would later change name to become Redbridge. Having scored on his debut, his stint did not last long, and was subsequently released in July 2004, with club manager Craig Edwards stating that the club would prefer "to go with younger players" for the coming season and that there were financial implications.

'''Christopher Anthony''' "'''Chris'''" '''Allen''' (born 18 November 1972 in [[Oxford]]) is an [[English people|English]] former [[Association football|football]] [[midfielder]], who now works at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] as a youth team coach.

A former [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] international, he started his career at Oxford United in 1991, playing 181 games in five years, helping to send the club on their way back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1995–96 Football League|1995–96]] before he signed with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for a £400,000 fee. He played 26 [[Premier League]] games for Forest, though played little part in the club's [[1997–98 Nottingham Forest F.C. season|1997–98]] First Division promotion campaign. Instead he was loaned out to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] promotion winners [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], before he was allowed to sign with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in March 1999. His career diminished in brief spells with [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] and [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], before he featured for non-league sides [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]], [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]] and [[North Leigh F.C.|North Leigh]]. He retired from playing in 2010, having helped North Leigh to win promotion from the [[Hellenic Football League]] in 2007–08.

'''Clive Darren Allen''' (born 20 May 1961) is a retired [[England national football team|English]] [[Association football|footballer]], a prolific scorer for a number of clubs.

Allen is the son of ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] forward [[Les Allen]], who was a member of the team which won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title and [[FA Cup]] "double" in 1961. He is the brother of former footballer [[Bradley Allen]] and cousin of football manager [[Martin Allen (footballer)|Martin Allen]] and ex [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur]] midfielder [[Paul Allen (footballer)|Paul Allen]].

==Club career==

===Queens Park Rangers===
He started his career at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the late 1970s, and scored 32 league goals in 49 appearances, before moving to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Clive Allen|url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/cliveallen.html|work=Post War English & Scottish Football League A&nbsp;— Z Player's Database|publisher=Neil Brown|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>

===Arsenal===
Allen signed for Arsenal in the summer of 1980 for a fee of £1.25m, but he did not play a single competitive match (although he did play three matches in Arsenal's [[1980-81 in English football|1980-81]] pre-season friendly campaign). He shortly moved on to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in a swap deal with [[Kenny Sansom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/Sol-Campbell-Clive-Allen-Joey-Beauchamp-and-the-Top-10-shortest-transfers-of-all-time-article128239.html|title=Sol Campbell, Clive Allen, Joey Beauchamp and the Top 10 shortest transfers of all-time|last=David Gerges|work=Mirror Football|publisher=Trinity Mirror|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>

===Crystal Palace===
Allen was Palace's top scorer for the [[1980-81 in English football|1980-81 season]] with nine goals in the league and 11 in all competitions, when Palace finished bottom of the First Division.<ref>[http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4387 Holmesdale.net]</ref>

===Return to Queens Park Rangers===
QPR, still in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], were now managed by [[Terry Venables]] (who had signed Allen for palace) and Allen's first season back at the club ([[1981-82 in English football|1981-82]]) revived his fortunes as he scored 13 Second Division goals, though not enough to win promotion. QPR also had their most successful [[FA Cup]] run, reaching the [[FA Cup Final 1982|FA Cup Final]] for the first time with Allen scoring the vital goals in 1-0 victories in both the 6th Round (vs [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]) and Semi final (vs [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]).

Over the next two seasons, Allen scored 27 League goals as QPR first won the Second Division Championship in 1982-83 and then consolidated their new status helping them to finish fifth in the First Division in 1983-84, but would be playing [[UEFA Cup]] football for Tottenham rather than QPR the following season as a £700,000 fee took him to [[White Hart Lane]].

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Allen scored twice on his debut and eight goals from 15 appearances in his first season, where Spurs finished third after being top of the league at Christmas.

In [[1986-87 in English football|1986–87]] he scored 33 League goals, and 49 goals in all competitions.<ref name=tott/>

His goal tally that season broke the Spurs club record held by [[Jimmy Greaves]], and remains unbroken. No player associated with any top division club has managed to match or exceed Allen's total of goals in all competitions since then, either. However, his top-flight league goals tally was surpassed by [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]] of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in [[1993-94 in English football|1993-94]] and [[1994-95 in English football|a year later]] by [[Alan Shearer]] at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].

He also picked up the titles of [[PFA Players' Player of the Year|PFA Player of the Year]] and [[Football Writers' Association|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]].

===Bordeaux===
He moved from Spurs to join [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in March 1988.<ref name=tott>{{cite web|url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/sites/spurs/History%20of%20the%20Club/great-players/clive-allen.page|title=Great players: Clive Allen|work=History of the club|publisher=Tottenham Hotspur|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

===Later career===
He spent just one season in France before returning to England in August 1989 when he joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who had just been promoted to the First Division. He scored 10 league goals as City survived their first season back in the top flight, but scored just four goals in 20 league games in [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91]]. He managed three appearances and scored twice in the league for City the following season, and was transferred to Chelsea in December 1991.

He scored seven goals in 16 league games over the next three months with Chelsea before he joined West Ham United in March 1992, scoring once in four league games and unable to stop them from being relegated.

He scored 14 goals in the [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93]] Division One campaign as West Ham were promoted as runners-up, but played just seven league games (scoring twice) in the [[1993-94 in English football|1993-94]] in the new Premier League.

In January 1994, when Allen was out of favour at West Ham United, Tottenham manager [[Ossie Ardiles]] (who had been his Tottenham team mate the previous decade) expressed interest in bringing Allen back to [[White Hart Lane]] as he looked to spend up to £500,000 on buying a striker to cover for the injured [[Teddy Sheringham]], but the transfer never happened.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-ardiles-looking-to-angell-or-allen-1406880.html Football: Ardiles looking to Angell or Allen]</ref>
Allen opted to drop down a division and join [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] for a fee of £75,000.<ref>[http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=5&united=Clive_Allen Welcome to the Wonderful World of West Ham United Statistics Clive Allen]</ref> In 1995 Allen ended his career with 3 games for [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].

==International career==
In the summer of 1984, Allen was given his first [[England national football team|England]] cap in a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], coming on as a [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]]. England won 2-0 but when Allen started against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] England lost 2–0. He received his third cap in a goalless draw against [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. On 29 April 1987, Allen got his fourth England cap in a goalless draw versus [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. He won his fifth and final England cap in another goalless draw, against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] on 17 February 1988.<ref>[http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=10 englandfc.com profile]</ref>

==Managerial career==
Allen was the Tottenham Hotspur reserve team coach under [[Martin Jol]] at White Hart Lane, as well as being a pundit for a variety of media organisations. He was coach of Spurs Reserves when they won the [[FA Premier Reserve League]] Southern Division in [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]].

After Jol's dismissal in October 2007, Allen took up the position of Interim Manager of the senior squad. He took charge of the team for one match, a 1-2 defeat by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[Premier League]], before handing the reins over to [[Juande Ramos]].

==Management career==

===Reading===
Allen began his management career as an assistant manager at hometown club [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], where he joined [[Alan Pardew]] when the Royals were in the relegation zone. The team produced championship form in their closing 20 fixtures, winning 12 and drawing 4 to secure a top 10 finish. Two years later they won promotion to Division One.

===Barnet===
Allen's first full manager role was at Conference side [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]], from March 2003 to March 2004. He succeeded from [[Peter Shreeves]], to whom he was assistant manager from March 2002. Allen built a team from scratch in pre-season of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] campaign. The team shot straight to the top end of the table, however Allen left for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] with a few weeks of the season remaining in a move that disappointed many Barnet fans. Under the guidance of new manager [[Paul Fairclough]], the Bees made the play-offs but were beaten in the semi-finals by [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]].

===Brentford===
[[File:Martin Allen, football manager, February 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Allen exiting the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] team bus at [[Victoria Park (Hartlepool)|Victoria Park]] in 2005.]]
Allen took over the from [[Wally Downes]] at [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in March 2004.<ref>http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/472385.print/</ref> He had a good run at the club, saving them from relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in what remained of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003–04]] season. In the [[2004-05 in English football|2004–05]] and [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] seasons he took Brentford to the play-offs with fourth and third place finishes respectively, but they were eliminated by [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] respectively in the semi-finals on both occasions. Allen won press attention during the 2004–05 season for the success of his self-described "two bob team",<ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-124598058.html</ref> which was composed of ageing pros ([[John Salako]], [[Andy Myers]], [[Scott Fitzgerald (footballer born 1969)|Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Jamie Lawrence]]), [[Free transfer (football)|free transfers]] ([[Deon Burton]], [[Chris Hargreaves]], [[Stewart Talbot]] and [[Isaiah Rankin]]) and young guns who would go on to play in the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] ([[Jay Tabb]], [[Stephen Hunt (footballer born 1981)|Stephen Hunt]], [[Sam Sodje]] and [[Michael Turner (footballer)|Michael Turner]]). Allen took Brentford to the fifth round of the [[FA Cup]] in two consecutive years, going out to Premier League sides [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the 2004–05 season (losing 3–1 in a replay, after a 2–2 draw at [[St Mary's Stadium|St Mary's]]) and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] 3–1 in the 2005–06 season. He also was in charge of one of the major [[Upset|giant killings]] in the fourth round in the 2005–06 season, beating Premier League side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 2–1.

At Brentford, he proved to be a very popular manager with the fans and an object of curiosity to opponents and media alike due to his unconventional managerial methods, which paid off due to the relative success Brentford had under him on a limited budget. He participated in a 25&nbsp;mile sponsored bike ride on November 2005 to raise funds for Brentford.<ref name="Sponsor Martin Allen">{{cite news

===Milton Keynes Dons===
Allen then dropped down a level to manage League Two team [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] for the [[2006-07 in English football|2006–07]] season, a club with heavy financial backing and ambitions from owner [[Pete Winkelman]], albeit one that had been in severe decline for the past few years and had dropped from the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] to League Two in three seasons. Allen managed to arrest the club's decline and took his team to the play-offs, but lost in the semi-finals to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]].

==Career==
At 17 years and 256 days old, Allen's appearance for West Ham United against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[1980 FA Cup Final]] made him the youngest player to appear in an FA Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], though [[James F.M. Prinsep|James Prinsep]] played at a younger age at [[Kennington Oval]] in 1879. Both records have since been broken.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/curtis-weston-history-man-or-just-a-footballing-footnote-1220953.html |title=Curtis Weston: History man or just a footballing footnote? |first=Glenn |last=Moore |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> His debut for West Ham had come on 29 September 1979 when 32 days after his 17th birthday he had appeared for the club in their 2–1 home win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the Second Division. He collected a Second Division title medal for the Hammers in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]] and helped re-establish them as a First Division side. He made 152 league appearances for the Hammers, scoring six goals, before a £400,000 fee took him to their London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 19 June 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Allen|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/west-ham-united-fc/paul-allen-9499/1979-80-1984-85_a12576/|work=Sporting Heroes|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>

Allen went on to play in two FA Cup finals for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], on the losing side in [[1987 FA Cup Final|1987]] but victorious in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/premier-league/paul-allen-still-remembered-for-the-cup-final-goal |title=PAUL ALLEN: Still remembered for the cup final goal he didn't score! |first=Dave |last=Smith |publisher=Professional Footballers' Association |date=10 December 2002 |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref> In eight years with Tottenham, he played 292 league games and scored 23 goals. He was voted player of the year for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992–93 season]], his final full season at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38000]</ref>

He remained at [[White Hart Lane]] until 16 September 1993, when a £550,000 deal took him to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He played 33 [[FA Premier League]] games in [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]], scoring once, but played just 10 league games without scoring in [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] and was loaned out for 17 games to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], scoring once in a 4–2 defeat away at [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] in [[1994–95 in English football|March 1995]]. He then signed for [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on a free transfer and helped them win the Division Two title (and promotion to Division One) in [[1995–96 in English football|1995–96]].

After retiring from playing football at the end of the [[1997–98 in English football|1997–98]], which he spent in Division one with Millwall, he worked for the [[Professional Footballers' Association]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article438151.ece |title=Caught in Time: West Ham win the FA Cup, 1980 |first=Greg |last=Struthers |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=27 March 2005 |accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref>

'''Joseph Ball''' "'''Joe'''" '''Allon''' (born 12 November 1966) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]]. A [[Forward (association football)|striker]], he scored 112 goals in 300 league games in a 14-year career in [[the Football League]].

Starting his career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1984, he failed to break into the first team and moved on to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] three years later. After a season with the "Swans" he signed with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. After scoring 50 league goals for the club he transferred to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 1991. After a season with Chelsea, including a loan spell with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], he joined [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. In 1994 he moved back to Port Vale permanently, before moving back to Hartlepool United via [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in 1995. He retired in 1998. He won three promotions with three different clubs, and was voted onto the Fourth Division [[PFA Team of the Year]] in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]].

==Playing career==
A forward, Allon started his professional career with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 1984, at a time when [[Jack Charlton]] was manager at [[St James' Park]]. At the end of [[1984–85 Newcastle United F.C. season|1984–85]] he starred in the [[FA Youth Cup]] final victory over [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], in which [[Paul Gascoigne]] scored a wonder goal. Allon scored twice in nine [[Football League First Division|First Division]] games in [[1985–86 Newcastle United F.C. season|1985–86]] and [[1986–87 Newcastle United F.C. season|1986–87]], before manager [[Willie McFaul]] moved him on to [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in August 1987. [[Terry Yorath]]'s "Swans" won promotion out of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in [[1987–88 Football League|1987–88]] after beating [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] 5–4 on aggregate in the [[1988 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final|play-off final]]. During the season Allon also scored against rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the [[South Wales derby]], in a 2–2 draw at [[Vetch Field]] on New Year's Day. He scored twelve times in 40 league and cup appearances in a partnership with [[Colin Pascoe]], before he returned to the North-East to join [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in November 1988, as one of [[Bobby Moncur]]'s first signings as manager.

The "Pools" struggled near the foot of [[the Football League]] in [[1988–89 Football League|1988–89]], and Allon scored just five goals in 26 starts.<ref name="inthemadcrowd">{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.inthemadcrowd.co.uk/cgi-bin/itmc_view_person.asp?oid=11|work=inthemadcrowd.co.uk|accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> The team again struggled in [[1989–90 Football League|1989–90]], though Allon managed 17 goals in 45 league starts to become the club's joint top-scorer with strike partner [[Paul Baker]].<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/> After new boss [[Cyril Knowles]] installed a defence to match the Allon-Baker partnership, the club won promotion in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]]; United finished third, but were only one point behind champions [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]].<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/> Allon hit 35 goals in 55 games in the campaign, and was named Hennessey Cognac North East Player of the Year and North East Football Writers Player of the Year, and was also voted onto the [[PFA Team of the Year]].<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/>

His form that season earned him a move to top-flight side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in August 1991, with manager [[Ian Porterfield]] paying a fee reported to be £250,000. However he failed to make an impact at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], and in February of the [[1991–92 Port Vale F.C. season|1991–92]] season he joined [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on loan, but made just six goalless appearances for [[John Rudge]]'s "Valiants", who struggled in vain to avoid relegation out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]].<ref name="kent">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Personalities|publisher=Witan Books|page=7|year=1996|isbn=0-9529152-0-0}}</ref> He only stayed for a few months of [[1992–93 Chelsea F.C. season|1992–93]], the inaugural season of the [[Premier League]]. It was rumoured that his friendship with [[Vinnie Jones]] led him astray and helped to bring about his poor form.<ref name="Joe Allon">{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=Ed|title=Joe Allon|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/2934/29/|work=wsc.co.uk|accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> In all he started just four games (with a further 14 substitute appearances) and scored three goals for the "Blues". He was sold to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in November 1992 for a club-record incoming fee of £275,000.<ref name="bees05">{{cite book |last= |first= |year=2005 |title=Brentford Football Club Official Matchday Magazine versus Hull City 07/05/05 |url= |location= |page=46|isbn= |accessdate= }}</ref> The "Bees" were relegated out of the First Division at the end of the [[1992–93 Football League|1992–93]] season under [[Phil Holder]]. He scored a total of 28 goals in 56 league and cup appearances at [[Griffin Park]].

Allon moved to back Port Vale – this time permanently – in March 1994.<ref name="kent"/> He scored twice in what remained of the [[1993–94 Port Vale F.C. season|1993–94]] campaign, helping the club to win promotion out of the Second Division.<ref name="kent"/> He bagged seven goals at [[Vale Park]] in [[1994–95 Port Vale F.C. season|1994–95]], before he was sold to [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] side [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] for £42,500 in July 1995.<ref name="kent"/> After just five games and three months at [[Sincil Bank]] he was on the move again, during which manager [[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] was replaced by [[John Beck (footballer)|John Beck]], and returned to [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]] when Hartlepool manager [[Keith Houchen]] splashed out £40,000. He scored nine goals in 24 games in [[1995–96 Football League|1995–96]] to become joint top-scorer, but a persistent knee injury restricted his first team appearances.<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/> He scored 11 goals in 34 games in [[1996–97 Football League|1996–97]] to again become the club's top-scorer, as Hartlepool finished just four points above the bottom of the Football League under the stewardship of [[Mick Tait]].<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/> His goal spree towards the end of the season helped the club to avoid a drop into the [[Football Conference|Conference]].<ref name="Joe Allon"/> He only made it onto the pitch five times in [[1997–98 Football League|1997–98]], but still found the net twice, before he retired due to injury.<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/> His total of 79 goals for Hartlepool puts him in seventh place in their overall list of top scorers.<ref name="inthemadcrowd"/>

==Post-retirement==
Between 2006 and 2008 Allon worked under ex-[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] teammate [[Dennis Wise]] on the coaching staff at [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. He has also appeared as a summariser and expert on local radio and remains a popular figure with Hartlepool United fans.

'''Daniel Lee "Danny" Allsopp''' (born 10 August 1978) is a former Australian [[Association football|football (soccer)]] player who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]]. He last played for [[Croydon City Arrows]]. He is a full international for the [[Australia national football team]], and is well known for being [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]]'s second highest, and the [[A-League]]'s seventh highest all-time goalscorer, behind [[Archie Thompson]], [[Shane Smeltz]], [[Besart Berisha]], [[Sergio van Dijk]], [[Mark Bridge]] and [[Carlos Hernández (footballer)|Carlos Hernandez]].

==Club career==
Allsopp started his professional football career with Croydon City F.C. in the [[Victorian Premier League]] competition, having been selected from the [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] in 1999

Allsopp then moved to England to trial for [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], and after scoring in City's first friendly match against [[Newquay F.C.|Newquay]] as well as some reserve team matches, he was signed for the club for the 1998–99 season. Allsopp's four goals in 25 games saw Manchester City promoted to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], but he struggled to find a regular place in the team as the team in the 1999–2000 season, and was loaned out to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].

He was loaned to [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] in early 2000, and scored four goals in just three league matches by end of the 1999–2000 season. The following season he went on loan to [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], where he failed to score a goal in his four league appearances. Allsopp returned on loan to Notts County, and scored four goals in three matches before being bought for [[Pound sterling|£]]300,000 by the club. In a three-season career, he scored 50 goals in 111 appearances (in all matches) before signing with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for 2003–04. The move provided more success for Allsopp, as he scored 15 goals in his first season and seven in 2004–05 as a regular in the line-up.

Allsopp negotiated an early release from Hull, and decided to return to Australia to play for new club [[Melbourne Victory]] under [[Ernie Merrick]], who had coached Allsopp during his time at the VIS.<ref>{{cite web| date=8 March 2005| title=Victory sign Hull's Allsopp| url=http://wwiii.sbs.com.au/a-league/index.php3?page=tn&tid=146&id=55286| accessdate=7 May 2006}}</ref> Despite making 20 starts in the [[A-League 2005-06|2005–06 season]], Allsopp was not nearly as prolific as at his previous clubs, and only managed three goals for the year. The season featured Allsopp's 250th match in all league competitions.<ref>{{cite web| date=21 September 2005| title=Danny's 250 milestone| url=http://www.melbournevictory.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=1630| accessdate=7 May 2006}}</ref>

The 2006–07 season saw a remarkable turnaround in Allsopp's scoring record at Melbourne. He finished the season as the league Golden Boot winner as highest scorer in the home and away fixtures. His tally of 11 made him the first A-League player to score a double figure tally and was one goal more than second place, teammate [[Archie Thompson]]. His 35 shots on target was also the equal highest with [[Newcastle Jets]] [[midfielder]] [[Nick Carle]].

During the 2009–10 A-League season it was confirmed that Allsopp had signed with [[Qatar]]i side, [[Al-Rayyan Sports Club]], for an undisclosed fee.<ref>{{cite web| date=8 September 2009| title=
Allsopp joins Qatar's Al-Rayyan| url=http://melbournevictory.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=29176| accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref> He had less than a year left on his contract with Victory.

On 22 September 2009, Allsopp made his debut for Al-Rayyan against Al-Kharatiyat, providing an assist for [[Amara Diane]]'s goal.

Allsopp joined [[Major League Soccer]] club [[D.C. United]] on 18 January 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2010/01/dc_united_signs_australian_str.html | work=The Washington Post | title=D.C. United Signs Australian Striker}}</ref> Allsopp and D.C. United mutually agreed to terminate his contract after just one season with the club.<ref>http://www.dcunited.com/press-release/2010/11/dc-united-and-danny-allsopp-part-ways</ref> On 24 December 2010 Allsopp rejoined with his team mates at the [[Melbourne Victory]], in a contract that will keep him there until the end of the 2012–13 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=
Allsopp back for more |work=Melbourne Victory |url=http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=37744 |accessdate=24 December 2010}}</ref>

On 18 October 2012 he announced his retirement from professional football.<ref>http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/Danny-Allsopp-announces-retirement/50647</ref>

In 2013, Allsopp will return to play for his boyhood club, [[Croydon City Arrows]].

==International career==
In 1995 he made his name in the [[1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship|under-17 World Championship]], where he was tied top scorer with five goals, including one in [[Australia national association football team|Australia]]'s 3–1 loss to eventual runners-up [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. His performance opened the door for his entrance into the Australian [[National Soccer League]], signing with [[South Melbourne FC|South Melbourne]]. He stayed with the club until 1997, having scored two goals in his 20 appearances.

Allsopp represented Australia again, this time at under-20 level in the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[Malaysia]], with Australia making it through to the second round before being knocked out by [[Japan national football team|Japan]].<ref>{{cite web| title=World Youth Cup (U-20) 1997 (Malaysia, June&nbsp;16-July 5)| url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesw/wyc97.html| work=[[RSSSF]]| accessdate=7 May 2006| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mq05ouqw | archivedate = 16 January 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> On his return he was signed for [[Carlton S.C.|Carlton SC]], but was loaned out to VPL club [[Port Melbourne Sharks]].

Meanwhile, Allsopp had become a regular member of Australia's under-23 national team (the "Olyroos") in 1999,<ref>{{cite web| title=Olyroos 1999 Matches| url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Olympics/1999.html| accessdate=7 May 2006}}</ref> and played three matches for one goal in 2000,<ref>{{cite web| title=Olyroos 2000 Matches| url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Olympics/2000.html| accessdate=7 May 2006}}</ref> but was not selected in the squad for the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Squad for 2000 Olympic Games| url=http://www.ozfootball.net/ark/Olympics/squads/Sep2000.html| accessdate=7 May 2006}}</ref>

Allsopp finally earned his first call-up to the [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] senior squad for a friendly match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] on June 2007 and came on as a 78th minute substitute in the 2–1 defeat by the South Americans. On 23 May he got his second  international appearance for Australia when he came on as a substitute for [[James Troisi]] in a friendly against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Qantas Socceroos squad named for Uruguay|work=Football Federation Australia|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/default.aspx?s=insideffa_newsfeatures_newsitem&id=10659|accessdate=22 May 2007}}</ref>

National coach [[Pim Verbeek]] described Allsopp's performance against [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] in February 2009 as "absolutely hopeless",<ref name=bag>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/24/2500041.htm Verbeek unleashes on 'hopeless' Socceroos pair]</ref> although he later added that "in the last games (for Melbourne) I have seen they were very good, so maybe it was because of Indonesia or the trip".<ref name="bag"/>

==Personal life==
Allsopp was born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and is married with two sons.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''Marco António Bernardo Parcana Almeida''' (born 4 April 1977) is a Portuguese retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]].

He started his career with [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]], going on to amass [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 90 games and five goals over the course of six seasons, also representing in the competition [[S.C. Campomaiorense|Campomaiorense]] and [[F.C. Alverca|Alverca]]. He also competed professionally in England, Spain and Cyprus.

==Football career==
Almeida was born in [[Barreiro Municipality|Barreiro]], [[Setúbal District|Setúbal]], and played youth football with [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. He started his senior career with [[Casa Pia A.C.]] on loan, moving to [[Sporting Clube Lourinhanense]] in 1996 as the latter acted as [[Farm team|feeder club]] to the [[Primeira Liga]] giants. For the [[1998–99 Primeira Liga|1998–99 season]], still in the top level, he was again loaned, now to [[S.C. Campomaiorense]].

In July 1999 Almeida was signed by [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s manager [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] on a year's loan, with a view to a permanent move.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jul/20/newsstory.sport3 'Detonator' breaks bank at Coventry]</ref> After impressing in pre-season [[Exhibition game|friendlies]]<ref>[http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/5633979.Solid_start_is_a_must_for_Dean/ Solid start is a must for Dean]</ref> he made his first-team debut as a 71st-minute [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Claus Lundekvam]] in a [[Premier League]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[The Dell (Southampton)|the Dell]], on 19 September 1999: within eight minutes, he was alongside fellow substitute [[Thierry Henry]] just outside the Southampton area, when the latter received a pass from [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]]. He stumbled while trying to clear the ball, allowing Henry to wrap his foot around the ball and send a rocket of a shot into the far corner of the Southampton net, in what was the Frenchman's first goal in English football.<ref>[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/henry-from-also-ran-to-thoroughbred Henry, from also-ran to thoroughbred]</ref>

Although Almeida made a few appearances for the Saints' [[Reserve team|reserves]], including scoring in a 2–2 draw with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on 22 September 1999, he was never again called into the main squad and, in December, the loan was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/sport/5631768.Football__Saints_let_Almeida_go_back_home/ Football: Saints let Almeida go back home]</ref> In the same country, he would also have unsuccessful trials with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in September 2000<ref>{{cite book|author=Duncan Holley & Gary Chalk|title=In That Number – A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |publisher=Hagiology Publishing|year=2003|page=473|isbn=0-9534474-3-X}}</ref> and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (managed by former Southampton boss Jones) in 2007; subsequently he returned to Sporting, being released in the following summer after which he re-joined Campomaiorense, now as a [[free agent]].

Almeida's most steady period came at [[F.C. Alverca]], which he helped promote from the [[Segunda Liga]] in [[2002–03 Segunda Liga|his second year]] by netting a career-best five times in 32 games. After three seasons he moved abroad again, going almost unnoticed at [[Ciudad de Murcia]] – Spanish [[Segunda División]] – and he subsequently returned to his country, playing one campaign apiece with second-tier sides [[F.C. Maia]] and [[Portimonense S.C.|Portimonense SC]].

In the following years Almeida, already in his 30s, alternated between his country's lower levels and [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] football.

'''Manuel Almunia Rivero''' (born 19 May 1977) is a Spanish retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].

He competed mainly in the Spanish lower leagues in his early years, only appearing in 26 [[La Liga]] games over the course of two seasons with [[Recreativo de Huelva|Recreativo]] and [[Albacete Balompié|Albacete]], after starting out at [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]].

Most of his professional career was spent with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], for which he signed in 2004, going on to play 175 official matches and [[2005 FA Cup Final|winning the 2005 FA Cup]]. He also had a short loan spell at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. 

In 2012, after his contract expired, Almunia joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and played there for two years, following which he retired.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in [[Pamplona]], [[Navarre]], Almunia started his senior career with [[CA Osasuna]]'s [[CA Osasuna B|reserves]] in 1995, going on to spend four seasons with the team in [[Segunda División B]]. Subsequently, he stayed in the same level, where he represented [[FC Cartagena|FC Cartagonova]] and [[CE Sabadell FC]].

In the 2001 summer Almunia first reached [[La Liga]], after signing with [[Celta de Vigo]]. He never represented the club officially however, being loaned to [[SD Eibar]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2001/07/30/pagina-23/447036/pdf.html|title=La cesión de Boban empieza a tomar cuerpo|trans_title=Boban loan starting to gain shape|publisher=[[El Mundo Deportivo (newspaper)|El Mundo Deportivo]]|language=Spanish|date=30 July 2001|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> (where he won the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]] in [[Segunda División]] for the [[2001–02 Segunda División|2001–02 campaign]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2002/05/27/pagina-24/491500/pdf.html|title=Liga a la baja|trans_title=Low league|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=27 May 2002|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>), [[Recreativo de Huelva]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2002/07/07/pagina-11/498183/pdf.html|title=Guerrero, muy cerca del Recreativo de Huelva|trans_title=Guerrero, very close to Recreativo de Huelva|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=7 July 2002|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> and [[Albacete Balompié]], the last two in the top flight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2003/07/23/pagina-32/549056/pdf.html|title=El Albacete se interesa por Jordi Cruyff y Almunia llega cedido|trans_title=Albacete asks about Jordi Cruyff and Almunia arrives on loan|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=23 July 2003|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>

Playing understudy to [[José Antonio Luque Ramírez|José Antonio Luque]] and César at ''Recre'', Almunia's debut in the [[Spanish football league system|main category of Spanish football]] came on 17 November 2002, following a [[Ejection (sports)|red card]] to the latter in a 0–3 away loss against [[Deportivo Alavés]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2002/11/18/pagina-14/509385/pdf.html|title=Baño de autoconfianza|trans_title=Bathing in self-confidence|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=18 November 2002|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> It was one of only two league appearances during [[2002–03 La Liga|the season]], as the [[Andalusia]]ns suffered relegation after ranking 18th.

At [[Albacete Balompié]], Almunia started as backup to [[Carlos Roa]]. However, after the [[Argentina|Argentine]] came down with illness he became first-choice,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2003/12/22/pagina-4/1505219/pdf.html|title=Lacruz y Prieto, con problemas gástricos|trans_title=Lacruz and Prieto, with gastric problems|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> going on to help his team easily escape relegation through a [[2003–04 La Liga|14th-place finish]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2004/05/24/pagina-21/756422/pdf.html|title=El Valencia va de fiesta en fiesta|trans_title=Valencia cannot stop partying|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> his first league appearance was on 9 November 2003, in a 0–1 home defeat to [[Málaga CF]] as Roa was suspended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/2003/11/10/pagina-25/565278/pdf.html|title=Mal partido en el Carlos Belmonte|trans_title=Poor match at the Carlos Belmonte|publisher=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|date=10 November 2003|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>

===Arsenal===
Almunia joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 14 July 2004 for an undisclosed sum, to provide back up to [[Jens Lehmann]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3877979.stm|title=Almunia joins Arsenal|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 July 2004|accessdate=29 May 2007}}</ref> He made his debut for his new team on 27 October in a 2–1 win at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for [[2004–05 Football League Cup|the season]]'s [[Football League Cup|League Cup]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3947065.stm|title=Man City 1–2 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 October 2004|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> and his maiden [[Premier League]] appearance came on 4 December against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4047547.stm|title=Arsenal 3–0 Birmingham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 December 2004|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> the highlight of [[2004–05 FA Premier League|his first year]] came in [[2004–05 FA Cup|the fifth round]] of the [[FA Cup]], a replay at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]: with the game finishing 0–0 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] and heading to [[Penalty shoot-out|penalties]], he saved [[Alan Quinn]] and [[Jon Harley]]'s attempts to book his team a place in the quarter-finals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4300405.stm|title=Sheff Utd 0–0 Arsenal (aet)|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> and was an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in [[2005 FA Cup Final|the final win]] over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

In the [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2005–06 campaign]] Almunia continued as second-choice to Lehmann, but found himself thrust into the spotlight when he replaced [[Robert Pirès]] in the 20th minute of [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]] of the [[UEFA Champions League]] against [[FC Barcelona]], as the German was sent off. He performed well for the most part, only conceding both goals in the 1–2 loss late in the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm|title=Barcelona 2–1 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=17 May 2006}}</ref>

[[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07]] brought Almunia 14 appearances for the Gunners all competitions comprised. This included [[2007 League Cup Final|the League Cup final]], lost to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6371613.stm|title=Live – Carling Cup final|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=24 February 2008}}</ref> He and Lehmann were by all accounts rivals off the pitch as well. In an interview with German television in October 2007, speaking about manager [[Arsène Wenger]]'s decision to drop him in favour of the Spaniard, Lehmann said: “It’s possible that some day I’ll feel like talking about the whole issue. But at the moment I’m just swallowing it all as part of the humiliation. But I think – and this is aimed at my dear manager – one shouldn’t humiliate players for too long. I won’t just fade away quietly. Almunia has not yet showed he can win matches for us. I’ve experienced this before and know what the others are expecting from the goalkeeper.” Five months later, Almunia responded: “I treat people the way I would like to be treated myself. To have someone here who hates me is just amazing. Every morning I wake up I know it is going to be the same. But I don’t care any more. I come into training and work with [[Łukasz Fabiański]] and [[Vito Mannone]]. They are better than him anyway.”<ref>''The Arsenal Companion'' (2nd ed) – Paul Donnelley (Pitch Publishing 2011)</ref>

Almunia finally won the battle for first-choice duties in the [[2007–08 Premier League|2007–08 season]]. Highlights included saving a [[Penalty kick|penalty]] from [[Robbie Keane]] to help Arsenal beat [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2–1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7145733.stm|title=Arsenal 2–1 Tottenham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 December 2007|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> He was given the number one shirt after Lehmann left for [[VfB Stuttgart]] at the beginning of the [[2008–09 Premier League|2008–09 campaign]], and he saved another important penalty on 21 March 2009, this time from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s [[Obafemi Martins]] in a 3–1 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7937084.stm|title=Newcastle 1–3 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> In June 2008 he signed a new four-year contract with the English club,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3379955,00.html|title=Almunia agrees Arsenal deal|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=3 June 2008|accessdate=1 August 2008}}</ref> but his subsequent performances were highly inconsistent, with brilliant displays in [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League semi-final first leg]] against Manchester United<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8010847.stm|title=Man Utd 1–0 Arsenal|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=29 April 2009}}</ref> and the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|2010 Champions League quarter-finals]] against Barcelona,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/0910/post/first-team/champions-league-arsenal-2-2-barcelona|title=Arsenal 2–2 Barcelona|publisher=Arsenal F.C|date=31 March 2010|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> and very poor ones which resulted in rumours arising that he would be sold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2010/07/09/2017471/arsenal-set-to-move-for-udinese-goalkeeper-samir-handanovic|title=Arsenal set to move for Udinese goalkeeper Samir Handanovic|publisher=[[Goal.com]]|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=10 July 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Manuel Almunia.JPG|thumb|Almunia warming up for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2006]]
Despite the speculation, Almunia started [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11]] as first-choice. However, on 25 September against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], he conceded a penalty (which he saved), let a tame shot slip through the near post and was caught out of position in the opposition's third goal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/9024632.stm|title=Arsenal 2–3 West Brom|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010}}</ref> He lost his place through injury and, upon his return, found himself third-choice behind the Polish duo of Fabiański and [[Wojciech Szczęsny]].

Almunia made a return to the team on 30 January 2011 against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in [[2010–11 FA Cup|the FA Cup]], and went on to play both games in the next round against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]. On 8 March 2011 he came on as a 19th-minute substitute for the injured Szczęsny against Barcelona in the [[UEFA Champions League]] last-16 stage, and made a series of saves as Arsenal lost 1–3 at the [[Camp Nou]] to exit the tournament, [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|3–4 on aggregate]]; he was voted [[Man of the Match]] by fans on the club's official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/match/report/1011/motm/first-team/barcelona-v-arsenal-choose-your-motm|title=Man of the Match against Barcelona – Almunia|publisher=Arsenal F.C|date=8 March 2011|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> 

With Szczęsny (dislocated finger), Fabianski (shoulder) and Mannone all out with injury, Almunia again became Arsenal's first-choice. On 19 March, during a 2–2 draw at West Bromwich, he was caught out of position along with [[Sébastien Squillaci]], gifting the home team their second goal; already with Lehmann back in the club as an emergency signing, Almunia injured his knee during warm-up of the fixture against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]; he did not appear in any more matches for the rest of the season.

On 30 September 2011, Almunia signed an initial one-month emergency loan deal with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] after [[Robert Green]] was ruled out for six weeks with a knee cartilage injury.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,,11685_7213697,00.html|title=Hammers land Almunia on loan|publisher=Sky Sports|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> He made his debut for the Hammers on 1 October in a 2–2 away draw against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2044076/Crystal-Palace-2-West-Ham-2-Sub-Carew-rescue-Hammers.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Crystal Palace 2 West Ham 2: Sub Carew to the rescue for Hammers|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|first=Alex|last=Montgomery|location=London|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=}}</ref> but, at the end of October and with Green's return to fitness, he returned to Arsenal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/7283471/Almunia-returns-to-Arsenal|title=Almunia returns to Arsenal|publisher=Sky Sports|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>

On 22 May 2012, Arsenal announced that Almunia and six other players would be released from their contracts as of 30 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1076621/manuel-almunia-shown-the-arsenal-door?cc=5739#|title=Almunia released|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

===Watford===
In July 2012, aged 35, Almunia signed a one-year contract with second division's [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], replacing [[Scott Loach]] who had moved to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2865682,00.html|title=Official: Hornets delighted with a magnificent seven signings|publisher=Watford F.C|date=30 July 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> He played his first game on 11 August in a [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup tie]] at home to [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], and kept a [[Shutout|clean sheet]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19124003|title=Watford 1–0 Wycombe|publisher=BBC Sport|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref> 

Having appeared in all thirty four of Watford's league games, Almunia injured his hamstring against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 23 February 2013. He proceeded to miss the next six contests as young understudy [[Jonathan Bond]] deputized in his absence, returning in a 0–0 home draw against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 6 April 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/130406-almunia-post-cardiff-757429.aspx?pageView=full#anchored|title=Reaction: "Happy with clean sheet"|publisher=Watford F.C|date=7 April 2013|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref>

On 12 May 2013, in [[2012–13 Football League Championship|the play-off semi-final second leg]] at home to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], Almunia made a double save from [[Anthony Knockaert]]'s penalty in injury time, with Watford leading 2–1 but still trailing on aggregate. The Yellow Army counter-attacked from the resulting saves and [[Troy Deeney]] scored another goal to put his team in [[2013 Football League play-offs|the decisive match]] against Crystal Palace, where a [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]] penalty in extra time meant the 0–1 loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22417772|title=Watford 3–1 Leicester|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

On 5 July 2013 Watford announced that Almunia had signed a new twelve-month deal, to keep him at the club for [[2013–14 Football League Championship|one further season]]. Manager [[Gianfranco Zola]] commented: "His experience and influence are so important for us and the impact he had at Watford last season was magnificent."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11686/8811025/Watford-goalkeeper-Manuel-Almunia-signs-new-one-year-contract|title=Watford goalkeeper Manuel Almunia signs new one-year contract|publisher=Sky Sports|date=6 July 2013|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> He left in June of the following year, as his link expired.

Almunia retired on 28 August 2014 on medical advice, after a rare heart condition was picked up during a medical with [[Serie A]] side [[Cagliari Calcio]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28966630|title=Manuel Almunia: Ex-Arsenal keeper retires with heart problem|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref>

==International career==
Almunia did not represent [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at any level. He stated on more than one occasion his desire to play for [[England national football team|England]], only provided that he did not receive a call-up from his nation of birth first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3052410,00.html|title=Almunia eyes international call|publisher=Sky Sports|date=16 January 2008|accessdate=17 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2009/05/01/futbol/futbol_internacional/premier_league/1241191339.html|title=Wenger pide a Capello que cite a Almunia|trans_title=Wenger asks Capello to call Almunia|publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>

'''Benjamin Robert "Ben" Alnwick''' (born 1 January 1987) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]].

Alnwick started his career at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2004, having progressed through the club's youth ranks, but never fully established himself in the first team. He left for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in January 2007, having made 19 league appearances, but never made more than a single league appearance for Tottenham. Instead, he spent several loan spells away from the club, at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]. He switched permanently to Barnsley in July 2012, and made 12 appearances, but was deemed surplus to requirements in September 2013, and his contract was terminated by mutual consent.

Alnwick has represented [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels, but has yet to represent the full international side.

His performances against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], the games that won [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] promotion to the [[Premier League]] and Championship win respectively, were impressive.

'''John Aloisi''' (born 5 February 1976) is a retired Australian [[association football|football (soccer)]] player and the former manager of A-League club [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]]. In a professional career that spanned 20 seasons, with league totals of 459 games and 127 goals, he was the first Australian ever to play and score in [[La Liga]], the [[Premier League]] and [[Serie A]]. 

He returned to his country in 2007, with four seasons in the [[A-League]]. Aloisi was an integral member of the [[Australia national association football team|Australia national team]] for more than one decade, and represented the nation at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], being an essential figure in [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)|the qualifying stages]].<ref name="WORLD CUP">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4435400.stm Australia reach World Cup finals]; [[BBC Sport]], 16 November 2005</ref> He also appeared for the Socceroos in two [[FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cups]]. Aloisi was described as a goal poacher who was able to "hold the ball up well and create opportunities for his teammates."<ref>{{cite web|title=Player Profiles|url=http://archive.is/kFN3V|publisher=Yahoo!7 Sport|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> 

==Club career==
===Early years and England===
Born in [[Adelaide]], Aloisi arrived in Europe aged only 16, signing with [[Standard Liège]] from [[Adelaide City]]. He did not appear in any official games for the club, and also played sparingly for his next team, fellow [[Belgian Pro League|top division]] outfit [[Royal Antwerp FC]].

In November 1995, Aloisi moved countries and signed for Italian side [[US Cremonese]]. On the 25th, only two minutes after being on the pitch, he scored in a 2–1 home win against [[Calcio Padova]], becoming the youngest foreign player to ever score in a [[Serie A]] match.<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/novembre/27/Dall_Australia_con_furore_John_co_0_9511275772.shtml Dall' Australia con furore: John Aloisi regala i primi 3 punti alla Cremonese (From Australia with furor: John Aloisi gives Cremonese first three points)]; [[Corriere della Sera]], 27 November 1995 {{it icon}}</ref> Ultimately, the [[Lombardy]] team suffered two consecutive relegations, and he left the club.

Aloisi arrived in [[Football in England|English football]] early in the 1997–98 season, signing for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in the [[Football League First Division|Division One]], under the chairmanship of Australia national football team manager [[Terry Venables]]. He scored 12 goals in his first season in England as Pompey narrowly avoided relegation, bettering that total to 13 in the following campaign.

On 18 December 1998, Aloisi moved to the [[Premier League]] with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who paid [[Pound sign|£]]650,000 for his services. He made his Sky Blues debut in a 1–1 home draw against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], appearing as a late [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]]; also coming from the bench, he netted in the next match, 1–1 against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

Aloisi's next notable performance came almost 12 months later, in a historic 4–1 win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at [[Villa Park]]. He scored twice in Coventry's first ever away victory in the league against their [[English Midlands|Midlands]] rivals. Starting in the next game, against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], he was [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] for punching [[Danny Mills]], receiving a considerable ban; both Portsmouth and Coventry combined, he finished the season with 18 goals.

Aloisi never really got a proper run at Coventry during his spell, as the team was constantly threatened with relegation, which befell at the end of the [[2000–01 FA Premier League|2000–01 season]] after a 34-year top flight stay, with the player scoring just three times (he did net a [[hat-trick]] against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for [[2000–01 Football League Cup|the season]]'s [[Football League Cup]] – 4–1 home win, 7–2 on aggregate<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/worthington_cup/943427.stm Coventry 4–1 Preston]; BBC Sport, 27 September 2000</ref>). In June, he was allowed to leave [[Highfield Road]], and came close to signing for [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]],<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38010 Coventry City biography]; at FootballHeroes</ref> but nothing came of it.

===Spain===
In 2001, Aloisi moved to Spain, joining [[Pamplona]]'s [[CA Osasuna]]. He scored nine goals in 30 games in [[2001–02 La Liga|his first season]] in [[La Liga]], being regularly used during his four-year spell in [[Navarre]]. On 11 April 2004, he played the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 away win against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=148966&cc=5739 Real Madrid 0–3 Osasuna]; [[ESPNsoccernet]], 11 April 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2004/apr/16/smalltalk.sportinterviews Small talk: John Aloisi]; [[The Guardian]], 16 April 2004</ref> and, on 11 June of the following year, he netted in the [[Copa del Rey]] [[2004–05 Copa del Rey|final]], equalising in an eventual 1–2 [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] loss against [[Real Betis]].

After a move to [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] collapsed,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4114874.stm Aloisi fails Panathinaikos test]; BBC Sport, 5 July 2005</ref> Aloisi signed for another Spanish outfit, [[Deportivo Alavés]], on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]]. Even though he scored a career-best (in Spain) ten goals in [[2005–06 La Liga|2005–06]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] suffered top flight relegation.

===Return to Australia===
On 20 October 2007, it was announced that Aloisi had signed with the [[Central Coast Mariners FC]] for the remainder of the season.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=483269&root=global&cc=3436&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab2pos1 Aloisi's A-League adventure]; ESPNsoccernet, 19 November 2007</ref> The team was able to not include his wages in the [[salary cap]] due to a loop hole relating to injured players.<ref>[http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/63393,aloisi-nows-the-right-time.aspx Aloisi: Now's the right time]; Australian FourFourTwo, 20 October 2007</ref> He made his debut in the [[A-League]] on the 28th against [[Sydney FC]], in a 2–3 defeat.<ref>[http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=hal_newsdisplay&id=19933  Brosque double sinks Mariners]; A-League official website, 28 October 2007</ref>

On 3 March 2008, after failing to re-sign with the Mariners, Aloisi penned a two-year deal with [[Sydney FC]], for an undisclosed fee reported to be $1.4 million a season,<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23306722-5000940,00.html Sydney unveil new signings]; [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]], 3 March 2008</ref> making him the highest-paid player based in Australia in any of the four football codes. He made his debut as a second-half substitute against [[Perth Glory FC]] at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], and scored his first goal for Sydney in a 2–0 upset win over archrivals [[Melbourne Victory FC]].

On 18 February 2009, 33-year old Aloisi was linked with a loan move to [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.]] in China. He soon decided against the deal, opting instead to spend the entire pre-season with Sydney FC, under the club's new coach [[Vítězslav Lavička]].<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25105036-23210,00.html Aloisi wary of Chinese burn-out]; Fox Sports, 25 February 2009</ref> He scored twice in a friendly with the [[Newcastle United Jets FC]],<ref>[http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/a-league/aloisi-double-sinks-jets-204112 Aloisi double sinks Jets]; The World Game, 12 July 2009</ref> and eventually started repaying the faith the team had in him by scoring a double in a 3–2 win against [[North Queensland Fury FC]] in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]], in the first game of [[2009–10 A-League|the season]]; he finished the campaign – winning both the minor and the major championships – as the first Sydney player ever to reach double digits in a single season.

On 29 March 2010, [[Melbourne Heart FC]] signed Aloisi on a free transfer.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/heart-signs-john-aloisi-20100329-r6b5.html Heart signs John Aloisi]; The Age, 29 March 2010</ref> He impressed at the new club and scored eight goals, including three against rivals Melbourne Victory, both the first goal ever in a [[Melbourne derby]], and a brace which equalised the game at 2–2 after the Heart had been 2–0 down. On 12 February 2011, he played the final game of his career against former team Sydney FC, in the last round of the [[2010–11 A-League|A-League season]], scoring and being replaced by in the 83rd minute by [[Kristian Sarkies]], to a standing ovation from the home crowd.<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/soccer/john-aloisi-on-target-in-melbourne-heart-farewell/story-e6frfg8x-1226005077979 John Aloisi on target in Melbourne Heart farewell]; [[Herald Sun]], 12 February 2011</ref>

==International career==
[[Image:Aloisi penalty - The Moment.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Aloisi taking the penalty that secured the victory over Uruguay and Australia's place in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].]]
Aloisi made his debut for the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national team]] in 1997. Also [[1997 FIFA Confederations Cup|in that year]], he was selected to the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]], scoring in a 3–1 group stage win against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] for the eventual runners-up.

After representing Australia at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] as one of the three overage players, scoring three goals in an eventual [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|quarterfinal exit]],<ref>{{FIFA player|154050}}</ref> Aloisi finished second in the scoring charts at the [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|2005 Confederations Cup]], netting braces against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] as the Socceroos did not manage one single point in three games.
 
On 16 November 2005, Aloisi scored the decisive [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL – OFC play-off)|playoffs]], after a 1–1 aggregate tie. That goal meant Australia qualified to the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time since 1974.<ref name="WORLD CUP"/> He was selected in the squad for the final stages in Germany and, on 12 June, came off the bench to score the third goal in a 3–1 group stage victory against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], thus becoming only the second Australian in history to score a goal at the World Cup finals, after teammate [[Tim Cahill]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4852706.stm Australia 3–1 Japan]; BBC Sport, 12 June 2006</ref>

On 21 July 2007, Aloisi scored in the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]]'s quarterfinal match against Japan (1–1), in an eventual penalty shootout exit in Australia's first ever participation in [[AFC Asian Cup|that tournament]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/6910021.stm Japan and Iraq reach semi-finals]; BBC Sport, 21 July 2007</ref> It would be the last of his 27 international goals, second-best behind [[Damian Mori]] at the time of his retirement.

After his return to the A-League, Aloisi ceased to be recalled by the national team. In early 2008, his penalty kick against Uruguay which took the Socceroos to the 2006 World Cup was voted by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame as one of three greatest moments in [[Sport in Australia|Australian sporting]] history.<ref>[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/aloisis-shot-of-confidence/story-e6frf9if-1111115456686 John Aloisi's shot of confidence]; Herald Sun, 2 February 2008</ref>

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Aloisi started his coaching career, being appointed youth manager at Melbourne Heart.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/john-aloisi-and-josip-skoko-look-to-coaching-after-ending-careers-as-senior-players/story-fn63e0vj-1226005406060 John Aloisi and Josip Skoko look to coaching after ending careers as senior players]; [[The Australian]], 14 February 2011</ref> On 8 May 2012, it was announced that he had accepted a three-year contract to be the manager of [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]].<ref>http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/news/1104757/Heart-plumps-for-Aloisi</ref> On 5 October 2012, he got his first win as manager as [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]] beat [[Melbourne derby|rivals]] [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] 2–1. Aloisi struggled in his first season as head coach, with Melbourne Heart coming ninth in the 2012–13 season and winning only one away game all season. The 2013-14 season did not start any better with the Heart managing 0 wins, 4 draws and 6 losses from 10 starts.  On 28 December 2013, Aloisi was sacked as the manager of Melbourne Heart following the club's seventeenth competitive match without a win.

On 9 February 2015, Aloisi joined [[Melbourne Victory FC]] as the development coach of its National Youth League and National Premier League sides.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.melbournevictory.com.au/article/melbourne-victory-appoints-john-aloisi-to-new-role/1kj46sx2irl4v1h0sfp13vmf1p |title= Melbourne Victory appoints John Aloisi to new role |publisher= [[Melbourne Victory FC]] |date= 9 February 2015 |accessdate= 9 February 2015}}

{{Spanish name|Alonso|Olano}}
'''Mikel Alonso Olano''' (born 16 May 1980) is a Spanish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Real Unión]] as a [[midfielder]].

==Football career==
===Real Sociedad===
A product of [[Real Sociedad]]'s youth ranks, as younger brother [[Xabi Alonso|Xabi]], Alonso was born in [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and made his debut in [[La Liga]] on 22 April 2001 against [[Real Valladolid]]. However, the presence of his sibling and [[Mikel Aranburu]] in central midfield meant that he was restricted to a supporting role, and he was then sent on loan to [[Segunda División]]'s [[CD Numancia]] for [[2003–04 Segunda División|2003–04]] but, while he was dedicated to the [[Soria]] team's bid for promotion, he remained keen to establish himself at Real Sociedad, returning at the end of the season;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noticias.info/archivo/2004/200401/20040116/20040116_17275.shtm|title=Mikel Alonso: "A la Real y a mí nos interesa que juegue cada Domingo"|trans_title=Mikel Alonso: "Real and myself are interested in me playing every Sunday"|publisher=Noticias|language=Spanish|date=16 January 2004|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> under the management of [[José Mari Bakero]], the player's importance to the team was demonstrated in the [[2005–06 La Liga|2005–06 campaign]], when he was the club's most used footballer playing in 37 games.

After brother Xabi had already settled in England with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (having arrived during the summer of 2004), Alonso also decided to move to the [[Premier League]]. He joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], another team in [[North West England|north-west England]], on a loan deal on 10 July 2007 with the option of a permanent deal at the end of [[2007–08 Premier League|the season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/6290040.stm|title=Alonso joins Bolton from Sociedad|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> However, after manager [[Sammy Lee (footballer)|Sammy Lee]] was dismissed he fell out of favour and, under new coach [[Gary Megson]], he only made two first-team appearances; subsequently, the Trotters opted to not extend his contract.

Alonso went back to Spain for [[2008–09 Segunda División|2008–09]] but, upon his return to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], discovered he was not a part of coach [[Juan Manuel Lillo]]'s plans and was sent on trial to [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos FC]]. This proved unsuccessful, however, and Real Sociedad exercised their right to buy the remainder of his contract, releasing him as a [[free agent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundodeportivo.es/web/gen/20080903/noticia_53530989163.html|title=El club presentará mañana el ERE con Alonso y Stevanovic|trans_title=The club will release Alonso and Stefanovic tomorrow under ERE legislation|publisher=[[El Mundo Deportivo (newspaper)|El Mundo Deportivo]]|language=Spanish|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref>

===Tenerife===
Following his release from Real Sociedad, [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] boss [[Roberto Martínez]] offered countryman Alonso a chance to regain fitness.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2008/12/11/alonso-enjoying-his-swansea-city-stint-91466-22451036/ Alonso enjoying his Swansea City stint]; The Western Mail, 11 December 2008</ref> After his brother highly recommended both coach and the player to arrange the deal, he accepted the offer and joined the squad in training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/swansea-city-fc/2008/12/14/alonso-my-brother-xabi-told-me-to-link-up-with-swans-91466-22470921/|title=Alonso: My brother Xabi told me to link up with Swans|publisher=Wales on Sunday|date=14 December 2008|accessdate=15 December 2008}}</ref>

However, Alonso would not remain in [[Wales]] and, in late January 2009, moved to second level outfit [[CD Tenerife]], after being contacted regarding a [[2008–09 Segunda División|season]]-long contract.<ref>[http://www.marca.com/2009/01/28/futbol/equipos/tenerife/1233166726.html El Tenerife confirma el fichaje de Mikel Alonso (Tenerife confirms Mikel Alonso's signing)]; [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], 28 January 2009 {{es icon}}</ref> He accepted the offer and stated that he had "heard good things" about Tenerife. However, he remained a fan of his former club Real Sociedad, stating that, although the team were rivals to Tenerife, he hoped they gained promotion;<ref>[http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/mikel-alonso-tenia-varias-opciones/dasftb/20090129dasdasftb_29/Tes Mikel Alonso: "Tenía varias opciones y Tenerife me pareció la más atractiva" (Mikel Alonso: "I had several options and Tenerife seemed the right choice")]; [[Diario AS]], 29 January 2009 {{es icon}}</ref> he contributed with 11 matches as the [[Canary Islands]] side returned to the top flight after a seven-year absence.

In the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 campaign]] Alonso began as a starter, scoring with a rare header in the second matchday, a 1–0 home win against [[Athletic Bilbao]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=275693&cc=5739|title=Athletic Bilbao lose 100% record|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=23 September 2009|accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref> However, he appeared less regularly in the final stretch, as Tenerife were eventually relegated back.

===Charlton===
In late June 2011, following [[2010–11 Segunda División|another Tenerife relegation]], 31-year-old Alonso returned to England, joining [[Football League One]] team [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10267~2379946,00.html|title=Mikel makes three|publisher=Charlton Athletic F.C|date=21 June 2011|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> He made his official debut on 5 October in the [[Football League Trophy]] tie at [[The Valley (London)|The Valley]] against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], conceding a [[Penalty kick|penalty]] in an eventual 0–3 home loss.

Alonso was released at the end of [[2011–12 Football League One|the season]], without making any appearances in any of the three major competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10267~2767632,00.html|title=Euell and Doherty head released list|publisher=Charlton Athletic F.C|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref>

===Real Unión===
On 14 July 2014, after nearly two years without a club, Alonso signed for [[Real Unión]] in [[Segunda División B]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realunionclub.com/hnot014.aspx?244,Primer+equipo,%27Silas%27+y+Alonso+se+suman+a+la+plantilla|title='Silas' y Alonso se suman a la plantilla|trans_title='Silas' and Alonso added to roster|publisher=Real Unión|language=Spanish|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
The first son of [[Miguel Ángel Alonso|Periko Alonso]], who played with Real Sociedad and [[FC Barcelona]], Alonso grew up surrounded by football: he and his younger brother, [[Xabi Alonso|Xabi]] – who also appeared for Real Sociedad before representing with individual and team success [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] – would go training with their father when he was playing for [[CE Sabadell FC]]; all three were midfielders.

Influenced by his father, Alonso followed his example and became a professional footballer at the [[San Sebastián]] side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/dads-and-lads-periko-and-xabi-alonso|title=Dads and lads: Periko and Xabi Alonso|publisher=Liverpool F.C|last=Balague|first=Guillem|date=18 May 2008|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>

{{Spanish name|Alonso|Olano}}
'''Xabier "Xabi" Alonso Olano''' ({{IPA-eu|ˈʃaβi aˈlons̺o oˈlano|lang}}, {{IPA-es|ˈ(t)ʃaβj aˈlonso oˈlano|lang}}; born 25 November 1981) is a Spanish [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for German club [[FC Bayern Munich]] as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]].

Alonso began his career at [[Real Sociedad]], the main team of his home province [[Gipuzkoa]]. After a brief loan period at [[SD Eibar]], he returned to Sociedad where then-manager [[John Toshack]] appointed Alonso as his [[Captain (association football)|team captain]]. Alonso succeeded in the role, taking Real Sociedad to second place in the [[2002–03 La Liga|2002–03 season]]. He moved to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in August 2004 for [[Pound sterling|£]]10.5 million. He won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in his first season at the club, scoring the equalising goal in the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|Final]] against [[A.C. Milan]]. The following season, he won the [[FA Cup]] and the [[FA Community Shield]]. He moved to [[Real Madrid]] for the start of the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]] in a deal worth around £30 million. After five seasons at the club, winning honours including a league title in 2012 and the Champions League in 2014, he was signed by Bayern Munich on a two-year contract.

He made his international debut for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in April 2003 in a 4–0 victory against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]. While playing for Spain, Alonso has won [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]],  [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], and he has also represented his country at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. On 23 June 2012, Alonso won his 100th cap for Spain in the quarter-final of Euro 2012 against [[France national football team|France]]: he celebrated the occasion by scoring both of Spain's goals to send them into the semi-finals. Following Spain's failure to progress out of the group stages at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], Alonso retired from international football on 27 August 2014. His 114 caps make him the fifth most capped player in the nation's history.

==Early years==
Alonso was born into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, [[Miguel Ángel Alonso|Periko Alonso]], won [[La Liga]] twice in successive seasons with [[Real Sociedad]] and a third time after he moved to [[FC Barcelona]]. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career.<ref name=GB1/> Xabi Alonso was born in the small town of [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. Alonso lived in [[Barcelona]] for the first six years of his life and moved to [[San Sebastián|San Sebastián (Donostia)]] thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at ''Playa de la Concha'' (Shell Beach).<ref name=GB1>{{cite web |last=Ballague |first=Guillem |title=Clever Xabi sets the pass mark |publisher=''[[The Observer]]'' |date=22 May 2005 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/may/22/sport.comment |accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref> On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, [[Mikel Arteta]], and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability.<ref name=FieldBB>{{cite web |last=Fifield |first=Dominic |title=Arteta seeks revenge in battle of Basques |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=25 March 2006 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/mar/25/newsstory.sport15 |accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref> He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, [[Mikel Alonso|Mikel]], to [[CE Sabadell FC|CE Sabadell]]'s training ground to practice together.

Alonso and Arteta were ambitious and dreamed of playing alongside each other for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side [[Antiguoko]], playing games at the weekend. Their performances attracted the attention of scouts from top Spanish sides and the young ''[[Donostia]]rras'' separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to [[Real Sociedad]] and Arteta moved to [[Catalonia|Catalan]] giants Barcelona.<ref name=HunterSS>{{cite news |last=Hunter |first=Andy |title=Mikel Arteta: 'It's a long way from San Sebastian...' |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=19 November 2005 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mikel-arteta-its-a-long-way-from-san-sebastian-515944.html |accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref> Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one as he was joined by his older brother [[Mikel Alonso|Mikel]], who had also become an adept player.<ref name=GB1/>

Alonso progressed through the youth ranks and the [[reserve team]] at Real Sociedad and impressed enough to earn a first team debut at the age of 18.<ref name=GB0/> He made his first senior appearance against [[CD Logroñés]] in December 1999 in a [[Copa del Rey]] match.<ref name=LFCProfile>{{cite web |title=Xabi Alonso Profile |publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/alonso/ |accessdate=11 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080804215916/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/squad/alonso/ |archivedate = 4 August 2008}}</ref> Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the [[2000–01 La Liga|2000–01 season]], [[Javier Clemente]] sent Alonso to [[Segunda División]] team [[SD Eibar]] to gain experience. Alonso's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player.<ref name=GB0/> A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and the new manager, [[John Toshack]], turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team's fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made 20-year-old Alonso the team [[Captain (association football)|captain]], a position traditionally held by more senior players.<ref name=GB1/> By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the [[Relegation#Structure|relegation zone]] and finished in 14th place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andrados |first=Juan Pedro |title=Primera División 2000/01 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |date=10 November 2001 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/span01.html |accessdate=12 August 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr6Wak4s | archivedate = 17 January 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.<ref name=GB1/>

==Club career==
===Real Sociedad===
Under the tutelage of [[John Toshack]], Alonso's captaincy marked a resurgence of form for [[Real Sociedad]]. Toshack recognised Alonso's potential and invested much time in his young captain, creating a training method designed to improve his touch and control specifically for him.<ref>{{cite web |last=Abbandonato |first=Paul |title=It's the Real deal for Toshack |publisher=Wales Online (''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'') |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-in-wales/2008/07/03/it-s-the-real-deal-for-toshack-91466-21218919/  |accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref> The team cemented their mid-table position in the [[2001–02 La Liga|2001–02]], finishing in 13th place. Alonso appeared consistently in [[La Liga]] with 30 appearances over the course of the season and also scored his first league goal, finishing with a season total of three. Real Sociedad's management changed again in the summer of 2002, with the arrival of [[Raynald Denoueix]] but Alonso kept his place in the first team on the strength of his past performance.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowe |first=Sid |title=Sociedad enjoy ride of their lives |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=4 November 2002 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/nov/04/europeanfootball.sport |accessdate=11 August 2008}}</ref>

The [[2002–03 La Liga|2002–03 season]] was the club's best league performance since the [[1981–82 La Liga|1981–82 season]], in which they won the league.

The [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04 season]] comprised mixed results for Alonso and his [[San Sebastián]] club. Alonso revelled in the opportunity to perform in Europe, appearing in all the team's games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout phase]] of the Champions League. The team struggled under the pressure of the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and finished 15th in La Liga.<ref name=Sinnott/> The combination of Alonso's outstanding performances and the team's poor league finish made a move away from [[Estadio Anoeta]] inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad.<ref name=GB1/> Madrid failed to meet the [[Pound sterling|£]]13 million price tag that [[José Luis Astiazarán]], the Real Sociedad President, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate.<ref name=Sinnott/> Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] tournament.<ref name=FDB/> Despite the fact that Alonso's appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer [[Jan Mølby]], who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.<ref name=GB1/>

The summer [[transfer window]] at Real Sociedad saw the arrival of Alonso's childhood friend [[Mikel Arteta]].<ref name=Drop>{{cite news |title=Real Sociedad drop Alonso |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/3552128.stm |accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref> Arteta was ecstatic at the prospect of partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived.<ref name=FieldBB/> Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] was being treated seriously.<ref name=Drop/> The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7 million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the [[Merseyside]] team.<ref name=LFCProfile/><ref name=AnfieldMove>{{cite news |title=Alonso makes Anfield move |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/3569648.stm |accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref> Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former [[Valencia CF]] manager [[Rafael Benítez]].<ref name=GB1/>

===Liverpool===
====2004–05: Champions League victory====
Alonso arrived at Liverpool along with [[Luis García Sanz|Luis García]] from [[FC Barcelona]], marking the beginning of a new era at [[Anfield]].

He made his return to the first team in the second leg of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter final against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

====2005–06: FA Cup winner====
[[File:CK that Aronso kicks.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Alonso taking a corner kick for Liverpool in March 2006.]]
Alonso was ever-present in the first team in the [[2005–06 Premier League|2005–06 season]], largely avoiding injuries that had marred his first season at the club. The summer [[transfer window]] brought [[Peter Crouch]] to Liverpool and the striker's height sparked accusations that the team would change to [[long ball]] tactics. Crouch denied this, highlighting that Alonso's passing ability, alongside Gerrard, would define Liverpool's style of play.<ref>{{cite news |title=Crouch defends Liverpool tactics |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4261110.stm |accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref> Alonso faced more competition for his place in the form of new arrival [[Mohamed Sissoko]]. However, Steven Gerrard's injuries and Rafael Benítez's favouring of a [[4-5-1|4–5–1]] [[Formation (association football)|formation]] ensured Alonso's place in the team. Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool's games in the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] but the dominance shown in the previous season had gone as the team lost to [[S.L.

===2009 Confederations Cup===
After Spain were surprisingly eliminated from the Confederations Cup by a defeat to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], Alonso and Spain faced [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in the third-place match. After 90 minutes the game was tied at 2–2, so extra time was added. Then in extra time Alonso scored an free-kick in to the bottom corner which helped Spain obtain the third place in the tournament.

===2010 World Cup===
Xabi Alonso started every game for [[Spain national football team|Spain]] during the 2010 tournament, playing alongside [[Sergio Busquets]] and [[Xavi]] in midfield and helping his side to lift their first ever World Cup trophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/statisticsandrecords/players/player=207528/index.html |title= FIFA player Statistics: XABI ALONSO |publisher=[[FIFA]]}}</ref> In the 28th minute of the final against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] he received a [[Kung fu]]-style kick to the chest from Dutch midfielder [[Nigel de Jong]], the foul was controversial since it appeared to be a foul worthy of a straight red but was only ruled out to be a yellow card given by Howard Webb. This left Alonso in pain and in fear of a broken rib.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/186572/Xabi-Alonso-in-broken-rib-fear-/ |title=Xabi Alonso in broken rib fear |publisher=the Daily and Sunday Express |author=Joyce, Paul |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> Despite this pain, he continued playing on for another hour.

The first goal came after he magnificantely headed a cross from the left flank delivered by [[Jordi Alba]], while the second one came from a penalty kick given after [[Pedro Rodríguez Ledesma|Pedro Rodríguez]] was fouled by [[Anthony Réveillère]] in the dying seconds of the match. Alonso's penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Portugal was saved by [[Rui Patricio]] in which Spain went on to win 4–2 after a 0–0 draw in game itself. Alonso and [[Spain]] went on to beat [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and [[Italy]] 4–0 in the finals. This was Alonso's 3rd major win with [[Spain]].

===2014 World Cup===
[[Spain]] were again amongst the favourites for cup victory in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] but had a very disappointing campaign ending in the first round. Alonso scored a penalty in the 27th minute of their first match against The [[Netherlands]]. However he was substituted in the 62nd minute with Spain losing 2–1. The match ended with a resounding 5–1 win for the Netherlands. Spain then suffered another defeat, this time 2–0 to [[Chile]]. In that match Alonso received a yellow card in the first half and was substituted at half time with the score already at 2–0. Spain were then eliminated from the tournament but did win their final match 3–0 against Australia and finished third in the group. Alonso played for 83 minutes against [[Australia]].

Alonso retired from international football on 27 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xabi Alonso: Real Madrid midfielder retires from Spain duty|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28959560|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=27 August 2014|date=27 August 2014}}</ref>

'''Josmer Volmy "Jozy" Altidore''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|t|i|d|ɔər}} (born November 6, 1989)<ref name="confedcup">{{Cite journal |title=Altidore gets his message across this time |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/9726684/Altidore-gets-his-message-across-this-time |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2009 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> is an American professional [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays for [[Toronto FC]] and for the  [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]].

Altidore made his professional debut in 2006 at the age of 16 with the [[New York Red Bulls]]. In the middle of his third season with New York, in 2008, he made a transfer to [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] for a fee of $10&nbsp;million. During his time with Villarreal, he left on three loan stints – with Spanish [[Segunda División]] club [[Xerez CD|Xerez]] in February–May 2009, English [[Premier League]] club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for the entire [[2009–10 Hull City A.F.C. season|2009–10 season]], and Turkish club [[Bursaspor]] where he went on a six-month loan. In the summer of 2011, he made a switch to [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] in the Netherlands. On March 3, 2013, Altidore surpassed [[Clint Dempsey]] for most goals by an American in a European club season with his 24th goal of the 2012–13 campaign. During the 2013 Summer transfer window, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] signed Altidore. He spent one-and-a-half seasons there, with a comparatively poor goalscoring record, then returned to MLS with Toronto.

Altidore has represented the United States on various levels of international competition, featuring for the [[United States U-17 men's national soccer team|United States U-17 team]] at the [[2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship]], [[United States U-20 men's national soccer team|U-20 team]] at the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], the [[United States U-23 men's national soccer team|U-23 team]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], and the senior national team at the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]], and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s.

==Early life==
The youngest of four children of a [[Haitian American|Haitian-American]] family, Altidore was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]] and raised in [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. He enjoyed playing soccer from the time he was a boy.<ref>Dampf, Andrew. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-06-24-1584081152_x.htm "Altidore gets his message across this time"], ''[[USA Today]]'', June 24, 2009. Accessed February 24, 2011. "Born in Livingston, New Jersey, to Haitian parents, U.S. Soccer is hoping Altidore develops into the consistent scorer the team has lacked for years. So far he's on schedule."</ref> Altidore played for various [[South Florida]] youth teams such as Boca Raton Juniors Soccer Club, Schulz Academy and Sunrise S.C while also spending time training with the under-17 national team at the [[IMG Academy]] in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]].

==Club career==

===New York Red Bulls===
[[File:Jozy Altidore RedBullNY.jpg|thumb|Altidore in a press conference with the Red Bulls in March 2008]]
Altidore was taken seventeenth overall in the [[2006 MLS SuperDraft]], with the [[New York Red Bulls|MetroStars]] (now the New York Red Bulls) trading up to receive the selection. Altidore spent the majority of the [[Major League Soccer 2006 season|2006 season]] away from the team while working towards his high school diploma in Florida.

Altidore made his professional debut on August 23, 2006, as a substitute in a 3–1 [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] loss to [[D.C. United]]. He scored his first professional goal at the age of sixteen with an 83rd minute, 28-yard shot to beat the [[Columbus Crew]] 1–0 on September 16, 2006. Exactly one week later, on September 23, 2006, in a 4–3 loss to D.C. United, Altidore scored again. Scoring three times in seven appearances, including a crucial goal against [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] on September 30, 2006, Altidore became a fan favorite. He scored the Red Bulls' only goal of their 2–1 aggregate loss to D.C. United in the Eastern Conference Semifinals Series when he headed in a cross in the second leg. With that goal, he became the youngest player to score in the [[Major League Soccer]] playoffs at 16 years, 337 days (breaking [[DaMarcus Beasley]]'s record by almost three years). Altidore was also youngest to start in a Major League Soccer playoff match on October 21 against D.C. United (16 years, 349 days). He also scored two goals in a 5–4 win over [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] on August 18, 2007.

===Villarreal===
On June 4, 2008, [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] of [[La Liga]] agreed in principle with Major League Soccer and the New York Red Bulls to sign Altidore for roughly $10&nbsp;million or €7.4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/sports/soccer/05altidore.html?ref=sports | work=The New York Times | title=Spanish Soccer Team Strikes Deal for Altidore | first1=Jack | last1=Bell | first2=Joshua | last2=Robinson | date=June 5, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/06/altidore-sold-t.html Soccer By Ives – Altidore Sold to Villarreal for $10&nbsp;million<!--Bot generated title -->]</ref> This transfer fee surpasses [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s fee for [[Clint Dempsey]], which was $4&nbsp;million or roughly £2&nbsp;million, and is now the largest fee paid for any MLS player. Altidore finalized his personal contract and was unveiled by the club on June 11, 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=U.S. striker Jozy Altidore excited by Villarreal move |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8235232/U.S.-striker-Jozy-Altidore-excited-by-Villarreal-move |publisher=''[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]]'' |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |format=  – <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AU.S.+striker+Jozy+Altidore+excited+by+Villarreal+move&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |postscript=<!--None-->}} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/06/altidore-agrees.html Soccer By Ives: Altidore agrees to terms with Villarreal, to be introduced on Wednesday<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On September 14, 2008, Altidore made his La Liga debut, coming on as a second-half substitute against [[Deportivo La Coruña]]. On November 1, 2008, he became the first American international to score in La Liga when he came on in the 90th minute and scored against [[Athletic Bilbao]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/altidore-scores-his-first-goal-for-villarreal/ | work=The New York Times | title=Altidore Scores His First Goal for Villarreal | first=Jack | last=Bell | date=November 2, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> On November 30, 2008, Altidore started his first game in [[La Liga]] against [[Recreativo Huelva]]. After spending a year and a half on loan, Altidore returned to Villarreal. He favored staying with Villarreal instead of another loan to try to prove to the club he was worth the investment they made two years ago.

Aluko was banned for two games for diving to win a penalty in the Rangers-[[Dunfermline F.C.|Dunfermline]] game of 3 December 2011.

====2012–13====
[[File:Sone Aluko 1.png|thumb|200px|Aluko playing for [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in 2012]]

In November 2012, Aluko picked up an Achilles injury, initially ruling him out for a month, which Hull City incidentally won all four games he was missing, but later in January the injury flared up again. This meant Sone would require surgery, with fears he would be out for 6 months, but after successful surgery, he was expected to be back in 2 months time.

====2013–14====
Aluko's first goal of the season, a 76th-minute "stunning volley", was Hull's winner in a 3–2 victory away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 21 September.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24089824 |title=Newcastle 2–3 Hull City |first=Ian |last=Woodcock |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref> In November Steve Bruce announced that Aluko denied a contract extension, this blow to Hull came shortly after Aluko tore his Achilles again which would see him out of action until February. He signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with the club on 3 January 2014, on the contract extension Aluko told the club website "I'm happy to be extending my stay here and I was always hopeful it would get sorted".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sone Aluko: Hull City forward extends Tigers contract|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25592339|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 January 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref> On 17 May 2014 he played as a substitute in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27354148|title=Arsenal 3-2 Hull|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=18 May 2014|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>

===Nigeria===

Aluko was named in the squad for the Nigeria under 20 natonal football team for the [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Egypt. He played in games against Venezuela, Spain and Tahiti.<ref>{{cite web|title=Technical Report and Statistics|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/technicaldevp/01/14/20/86/u20report_v2.pdf|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=7 July 2014|page=144|date=2009}}</ref>

Aluko was called up to the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigerian national team]] for a [[exhibition game|friendly]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 29 May 2009,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.completesportsnigeria.com/details.php?category=news&id=8281 |title=Amodu Lists Four New Players For Exhibition Game |work=Complete Sports |location=Nigeria |date=25 May 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref> an offer which with the support of his family he chose to accept.<ref name=AFC090526/> He made his full international debut in the starting eleven, forcing the Irish goalkeeper to save his 40-yard lobbed free kick and playing the first 61 minutes of the game.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_report/0,19764,11065_3126020,00.html |title=Keane strike seals draw |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_facts/0,19762,11065_3126020,00.html |title=Match facts |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=30 May 2009}}</ref>

In April 2010, he was named in the provisional Nigeria squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kickoff.com/news/14936/utaka-gets-nigeria-recall.php |title=Utaka gets Nigeria recall |publisher= Kickoff.com |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> but failed to make the final cut. He was finally called up by current Nigerian coach Stephen Keshi and therefore has a chance to add to his one cap against Republic of Ireland in May 2009 after he represented England at various age-group levels. He was brought into the squad to face Namibia and Malawi in the World Cup Qualifiers in the month of June 2012, but was an unused sub for both games.

Aluko was included in a pre-selection for the [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations]] but had to renounce because of an injury.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nigerianwatch.com/news/954-achilles-injury-rules-sone-aluko-out-of-nations-cup|title=Achilles injury rules Sone Aluko out of Nations Cup|publisher= Nigerianwatch.com |date=12 November 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> Nigeria later won the tournament.

==Club career==

===Early career===

As a child, Álvarez played [[papi fut]] for Caballito Juniors and Club Parque, and then had a brief stay in [[Boca Juniors]] youth divisions.<ref name=goal>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/es-us/news/2214/mercado/2011/04/15/2442618/talentos-de-exportaci%C3%B3n-ricky-%C3%A1lvarez-la-magia-polifuncional-que- |title=Talentos de Exportación: Ricky Álvarez, la magia polifuncional que necesita Europa |author=Martín Manrupe |publisher=Goal.com |language=Spanish |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2011-05-23 }}</ref>

===Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield===

Álvarez played his first professional game with [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sársfield]] in 2008. Following his debut, he suffered a [[knee]] [[cruciate ligament]] injury that stalled his progression on the first team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infovelez.com.ar/nota3665.htm |title=En Vélez siempre se tiene que pelear todo |author=Rubén David Oliva |publisher=Diario Infovelez |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-07-10 }}</ref> He then was part of the [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2009 Clausura]] winning squad, playing only 18 minutes in the 1–0 victory over [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de Jujuy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ricardo Álvarez 2009 Clausura stats |publisher=Fútbol Pasión |url=http://www.futbolpasion.com/jugador_presencias.cfm?id=ravz&Campeonato=cl09&Equipo=vel |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-07-11 }}</ref>

The midfielder's breakthrough with the team finally came during the [[2009–10 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Clausura|2010 Clausura]], in which Vélez, forced by the tight fixture of the [[2010 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]], played mostly with substitutes. He scored his first goal in a 1–2 defeat to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Buonanotte volvió al gol y fue el héroe del triunfo de River |newspaper=TyC Sports |date=2010-04-30 |url=http://www.tycsports.com/notas/55557-buonanotte-volvio-al-gol-y-fue-el-heroe-del-triunfo-river |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> and received his first red card from referee Javier Collado in Vélez' 1–3 defeat to [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]], for complaining about a yellow card. He totalled 11 matches during the tournament (4 as a starter), and 1 goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinesoccer.com/player_apps.cfm?id=ravz&Championship=cl10&Team=vel |title=Closing '10 statistics |publisher=Argentine Soccer |accessdate=2011-05-23 }}</ref>

Álvarez then played 15 games (2 starts) during Vélez' runner-up [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Apertura|2010 Apertura]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinesoccer.com/player_apps.cfm?id=ravz&Championship=ap10&Team=vel |title=Opening '10 statistics |publisher=Argentine Soccer |language=Spanish |accessdate=2011-05-23 }}</ref> He also scored his second professional goal in his team's 1–0 home victory over [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] for the 14th fixture.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canchallena.com/1324714-aprovecho-su-oportunidad-velez-gano-y-se-trepo-a-la-punta |title=Aprovechó su oportunidad: Vélez ganó y se trepó a la punta |newspaper=Cancha Llena |language=Spanish |date=2010-11-14 |accessdate=2010-11-14 }}</ref>

During the first semester of 2011, Álvarez got significant fan and media praise for his [[2010–11 Argentine Primera División season#Torneo Clausura|league]] and [[2011 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]]' games. He also showed versatility by playing all the positions of the midfield.<ref name=goal/> During that semester, he helped his team win the 2011 Clausura and reach the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores.

===Internazionale===

On 5 July 2011, Álvarez joined Italian club [[Inter Milan|F.C. Internazionale Milano]] for a €12.8 million fee, for 90% of his transfer rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canchallena.com/1387046-ricky-a-inter |title=Ricky Alvarez, el nuevo argentino de Inter |newspaper=[[La Nación|Cancha Llena]] |language=Spanish |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2011-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.velezsarsfield.com.ar/futbol/notas/2011/07/05/215203.html |title=La Maravilla se muda a Italia |publisher=Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield |language=Spanish |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2011-07-06 }}</ref> He debuted officially for his club in the [[2011 Supercoppa Italiana]] defeat to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Under the coaching of [[Claudio Ranieri]], Álvarez began to establish himself in the team as he show he can play as a trequartista. His first official goal for Inter came against [[Trabzonspor]] on November 22, 2011 after a neat one-two with international teammate [[Diego Milito]]. He scored again in his side's 4–1 victory over [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], a tap in from a well worked cross by [[Yuto Nagatomo]].

He scored his first goal for Inter in 2013 against [[Catania Calcio|Catania]] in a 3–2 comeback win. He scored two goals on 7 April against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], although Inter lost that match 3–4 in the [[San Siro]]. Ten days later in a [[2012–13 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] match at the San Siro, he scored again against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], but Inter lost the match 2-3. On 5 May Álvarez scored from a penalty kick against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] at the [[Stadio San Paolo]] but his team lost 3–1. Álvarez scored his 10th goal for Inter three days later  against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and missed a penalty kick, as Inter lost 1–3.

===Sunderland===

Sunderland signed Alvarez on September deadline day 2014. Alvarez initially signed on loan with a view to a permanent switch if Sunderland avoided relegation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland sign Sebastian Coates & Ricardo Alvarez on deadline day|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29012722|accessdate=13 September 2014|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 September 2014}}</ref> Alvarez made his [[Premier League]] debut on 13 September 2014, playing 65 minutes in a 2-2 draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C|Tottenham]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland 2-2 Tottenham |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29090585|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 September 2014}}</ref>  He scored his first goal on 3 February 2015 in a 3-1 win against [[Fulham F.C|Fulham]] in an [[FA Cup]] fourth-round replay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fulham 1-3 Sunderland |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30991113|accessdate=3 February 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 February 2015}}</ref> 

==International career==
On 18 August 2011, Álvarez was called for the first time to the [[Argentina national football team]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14876:lista-de-convocados-para-los-amistosos-ante-venezuela-y-costa-rica&catid=164:seleccion-mayor&Itemid=66 |title=Lista de convocados para los amistosos ante Venezuela y Nigeria |publisher=[[Argentine Football Association|AFA]] |language=Spanish |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2011-08-20 }}</ref>

'''Afonso Alves Martins Júnior''' (born 30 January 1981), known as simply '''Afonso Alves''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|striker]]. 
Alves enjoyed the most successful period of his career playing at [[SC Heerenveen|Heerenveen]] in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], where his goal-to-game ratio was higher than a goal a game. This precipitated a club record move to [[Football in England|English]] club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in January 2008. Alves has been [[cap (sport)|capped]] for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on eight occasions.

==Early life==
Alves was born on 30 January 1981, in [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil's third biggest city. He was brought up by his mother, Dona Eliade, and has a brother, Alexsander, and sister, Alexandra. His father died when he was nine years old.<ref name="mail interview">{{cite news

==Club career==

===Early career===
Alves started his career with Brazilian side [[Atlético Mineiro]]. In 2002 he left Atlético Mineiro for the Swedish club [[Örgryte IS|Örgryte]] from [[Göteborg]]. In 2004 he moved to [[Malmö FF]], where he won the [[Allsvenskan|Swedish League]] that year. He stayed for the 2005 season, scoring 14 in 24 games, becoming the club's top-scorer for the second year running when Malmö finished fifth. Alves was at Malmö for the start of the [[2006 Allsvenskan|2006 season]], and scored three goals in seven matches.

===Heerenveen===
[[File:Afonso Alves.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Afonso Alves with Heerenveen]]
In Summer 2006, he moved to the Dutch club [[SC Heerenveen]] of the [[Eredivisie]] for €4.5&nbsp;million, which remains their highest-ever transfer fee paid.

In his first season, he finished as top goalscorer of the [[Eredivisie 2006/2007|Eredivisie]] with 34 goals (in 31 games), which is a club record. Alves is the third Brazilian to become topscorer in the Dutch first division, joining former [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] strikers [[Romário]] and [[Ronaldo]], and the second Brazilian who scored over 30 goals in the same competition, with Ronaldo netting 30 in the 1994–95 season. Other than finishing first in the scorers table, he was runner-up in the race for the [[European Golden Boot]], a single point behind [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] forward [[Francesco Totti]].

On 7 October 2007, in only his second appearance of the season, Alves scored seven goals in his side's 9–0 victory over Eredivisie rivals [[Heracles Almelo]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Report: Heerenveen vs SC Heracles Almelo | publisher=soccernet.com | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=229746&cc=5901&league=NED.1 | accessdate=31 August 2008 }}</ref> setting a new [[Eredivisie]] record for most goals scored in a single match. Heerenveen's manager (Gert-Jan Verbeek) had already made three substitutions yet chose to take Alves off the pitch in the 89th minute to pay tribute to his fantastic performance.

Despite his impressive track record, his departure was surrounded by some controversy after he did not show up at several training sessions, while still under contract at SC Heerenveen and some remarks he made, insinuating that teammates in the Brazilian national team laughed at him for playing for such a small club.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Middlesbrough===
[[File:Afonso Alves 18-10-2008 1.jpg|thumb|Alves with Middlesbrough]]
In the January transfer window of the 2007-08 season  he moved to [[Premier League]] side [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 31 January 2008. Alves' transfer fee was said to have been €20 million, on a four and a half year contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boro smash transfer record for Alves|publisher=mfc.co.uk|url=http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~1230553,00.html|accessdate=31 January 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080203164730/http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~1230553,00.html| archivedate= 3 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref>

He made his debut on 9 February, against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] as a second-half substitute for [[Lee Dong-Gook]]. His first Middlesbrough start came on 27 February in an [[FA Cup]] home tie against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], when he was substituted in the 73 minute. Middlesbrough eventually won the game 1–0.<ref>{{cite news

Alves' first goal of the 2008–09 season came on 30 August, where he scored a 25-yard free-kick which flew into the top corner of the [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] net.<ref>{{cite web|author=DokterRamses |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGfVCryGBaw |title=Amazing Free Kick by Afonso Alves‏ |publisher=YouTube |date=25 September 2008 |accessdate=7 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110621094156/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGfVCryGBaw| archivedate= 21 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He then scored goals against Blackburn Rovers and a penalty against Manchester City, two against Barrow and one against local rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C|Sunderland]] with a goal from 18 yards out. However, Alves could not find the form which led to his record move, and with a haul of just four league goals the season turned out to be a disappointing one for both him and Middlesbrough, who were relegated to the Championship.

On 4 September 2009 Alves moved to Al-Sadd on a three-year deal for £7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|author=England |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/09/05/1482661/afonso-alves-joins-al-sadd-from-middlesbrough |title=Afonso Alves Joins Al-Sadd From Middlesbrough |publisher=Goal.com |date=5 September 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref> He scored 2 goals in 12 league matches, and scored one goal in the [[Qatari Stars Cup]] after three games. Alves then accepted a loan bid from another [[Qatari League]] club, [[Al Rayyan SC]].

====Al-Rayyan (loan)====
On 31 January 2010, Alves was loaned to the Qatari seven-time league champion [[Al Rayyan SC]], coached by the Brazilian coach [[Paulo Autuori]]. Alves scored 18 goals on his loan spell, 9 of them in seven matches of the [[AFC Cup]], and seven goals in seven league matches. He officially moved to Al-Rayyan in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-ahliclub.com/english/viewarticle.php?articleid=2351 |title=Al-Ahli Sports Club :: Al Sadd loan Brazilian Alves to Al-Rayyan in the main transfer of winter |publisher=Al-ahliclub.com |accessdate=7 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110707102129/http://www.al-ahliclub.com/english/viewarticle.php?articleid=2351| archivedate= 7 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Al-Rayyan===
[[File:Afonso Alves 2011.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Alves in Al-Rayyan colours]]
Alves officially moved to [[Al Rayyan SC]] for a further two years after winning the [[2010 Emir of Qatar Cup]] with Al Rayyan on the 15th of May, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=1211900.html |title=Al Rayyan clinch Emir Cup |publisher=FIFA.com |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

Alves shortly emerged as a fan favorite, however he suffered a ligament injury in his left knee in December which kept him out of action for eight months. While recovering, he stated "Offers may’ve come to me during the transfer period, but I never bothered to listen to them and left them all to my agent. While recuperating from surgery, I remained in touch with coach Paulo (Autuori) and the club management, and kept them updated on my progress." He is expected to rejoin Al-Rayyan as their top striker and start the [[2011–12 Qatar Stars League|2011–12]] season in Al-Rayyan's starting eleven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qfa.com.qa/fit-again-afonso-ready-to-lead-rayyans-challenge.aspx |title=Fit-again Afonso ready to lead Rayyan's challenge  |publisher=QFA.com.qa |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref>

===Al Gharafa===
On 11 September 2012, he signed a 1–year deal with [[Qatar Stars League|QSL]] giants [[Al-Gharafa Sports Club|Al Gharafa]] as their fourth professional player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qsl.com.qa/Users/newsen/NewsDetails.aspx?pid=895|title=Al Gharafa sign up Afonso for one season|publisher=[[Qatar Stars League]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref>

==International career==
On 17 May 2007, Alves received his first call-up for the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian national team]] for friendlies against [[England national football team|England]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].<ref>{{cite news | title=The 'lazy' Brazilian who says he'll catch England napping |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=458867&in_page_id=1779 | accessdate=1 June 2007 | date=31 May 2007}}</ref> On 1 June, in the game against England, Alves was brought on to replace [[Kaká]] after 71 minutes of play and very nearly scored after a [[Wes Brown]] slip. He was also part of the Brazilian squad which won the [[Copa America 2007]] in Venezuela. Alves scored his first international goal on September 12, 2007 against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in a 3–1 win.

==Personal life==
Alves left Brazil as a 21-year-old in 2002 to move to [[Sweden]]. He has a son, Felipe Henrique, who is a footballer at [[Atletico Mineiro]]'s Tupinambas Academy, and lives with Alves' former girlfriend in Brazil.<ref name="mail interview"/>

'''Paulo Lourenço Martins Alves''' (born 10 December 1969) is a Portuguese retired [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre forward|centre forward]], and the current [[Coach (sport)|coach]] of [[S.C. Beira-Mar]].

He amassed [[Primeira Liga]] totals of 301 games and 78 goals over the course of 13 seasons, mainly with [[Gil Vicente F.C.|Gil Vicente]] (five years). He also represented in the competition [[C.S. Marítimo]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting]] (three apiece) [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]] (two) and [[S.C. Braga|Braga]].

Alves started coaching in 2005 and went on to be in charge of several clubs, including Gil.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]], Alves moved from local club to [[F.C. Porto]]'s youth ranks at 17, but had no success there, moving to [[Gil Vicente F.C.]] as a member of which he helped [[Portugal national under-20 football team|Portugal]] win the [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] – in the group stage opener against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], he scored a [[Last-minute goal|last minute]] header (his strongest asset) for the game's only goal.<ref>{{FIFA player|160202}}</ref> Later in his career he also managed 14 [[Portugal national football team|full]] [[Cap (sport)|caps]], scoring seven times, all during the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] [[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying|qualifying stage]] and [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] within that period.

After spells with [[F.C. Tirsense]], [[C.S. Marítimo]] (twice) and [[S.C. Braga|Sporting de Braga]], Alves joined [[Primeira Liga|first division]] giants [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]], being relatively used during his three-year stay. He also played in England with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on [[Loan (association football)|loan]], but managed just four [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] appearances in his three-month stint; upon his return to [[Lisbon]], he notably scored a [[hat-trick]] in a 6–3 win at [[S.C. Campomaiorense]].

Alves then spent two seasons with [[U.D. Leiria|União de Leiria]], netting six times in 27 matches in [[2000–01 Primeira Liga|his last]] to help the club to its best ever top flight finish, a fifth position. His second stint at Gil Vicente saw him finish as the club's top scorer for the [[2001–02 Primeira Liga|2001–02 campaign]], with 11 goals in 27 games; he retired in June 2005, at the age of 35.

==Manager career==
After retiring Alves immediately took up coaching, precisely with the [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]] outfit. In 2008 he joined another team he played for, Leiria, also in the [[Liga de Honra|second level]].

Due to poor results in the [[2008–09 Liga de Honra|2008–09 season]] Alves was sacked by União de Leiria, but stayed in the category by moving to [[F.C. Vizela]]. In the following summer he rejoined former Sporting teammtate [[Oceano da Cruz|Oceano]]'s coaching staff at the [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portuguese U21 team]], while also being charged with the [[Portugal national under-20 football team|under-20s]]; after a handful of games he resigned and returned to Gil Vicente, [[2010–11 Liga de Honra|winning the 2011 division two championship with the subsequent promotion]].

After three years, which also brought a [[2011–12 Taça da Liga|runner-up place]] in the [[Taça da Liga|domestic league cup]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-carlsberg-cup-news/32876-taca-da-liga-final-live-text-updates|title=Benfica win Taça da Liga|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> Alves replaced former national teammate [[Abel Xavier]] at the helm of [[S.C. Olhanense]] early into [[2013–14 Primeira Liga|2013–14]], being sacked after less than three months in charge and with only one point won in six league games.

'''Darren Paul Francis Ambrose''' (born 29 February 1984) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who currently plays for [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. Ambrose, an [[attacking midfielder]], started his career at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], and played for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] prior to his move to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. He spent time on loan at [[Greek Superleague]] club [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon Smyrni]] before leaving Birmingham when his contract expired at the end of the 2013–14 season.

He also made ten appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21]] side, scoring twice.

==Club career==

===Ipswich Town===
Born in [[Harlow]], [[Essex]], Ambrose started his career at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and made his debut as an 18-year-old against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 21 April 2002, replacing [[Martijn Reuser]] during a 2–0 defeat at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1938548.stm|title=Arsenal go top|publisher=BBC Sport|date=21 April 2002|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> Ipswich lost their Premiership status the following month, though Ambrose started brightly in the next campaign, scoring on his full debut in a 2–0 victory against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] at the Bescot stadium, and went on to score ten more goals in 37 appearances, combining superbly throughout the season with his close friend, striker [[Darren Bent]]. In March, however, with Ipswich having fallen into administration, Ambrose was sold to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for what was considered a bargain £1m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2882977.stm |title= Ambrose signs for Magpies |date=25 March 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> The sale was ordered by the administrators, and completed at Newcastle by former Ipswich manager [[Bobby Robson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/darren_plans_to_dampen_town_s_cheer_1_175916 |title=Darren plans to dampen Town's cheer |publisher=Eastern Daily Press |date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2013 |author=King, Elvin}}</ref>

===Newcastle United===
In total, he scored 6 goals in 56 appearances for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2341953,00.html |author=Blackmore, Ben |title=Ambrose wants to play |publisher=SkySports |date=July 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref>

===Charlton Athletic===
He joined [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 8 July 2005 for a fee estimated to be in the region of £1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4663085.stm |title=Charlton sign Newcastle's Ambrose |date=8 July 2005|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref>

After failing to gain promotion back to the Premier League in 2007–08, Ambrose was sent to former club Ipswich Town on loan in the first half of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09]] season due to financial reasons, (ironically under similar circumstances to that of when Ambrose first moved from Ipswich in 2003)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7721498.stm |title=Ambrose rejoins Ipswich on loan |date=11 November 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> with rumours that Ipswich were reportedly interested in making the deal permanent in January 2009 for an estimated fee of £250,000, although no deal eventually materialised.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer/08/12/31/manual_172308.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110605030408/http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=nonwire_soccer/08/12/31/manual_172308.html |title=Ambrose Back With Addicks |date=31 December 2008 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |website=sportinglife.com |publisher=365 Media Group}}</ref>

===Crystal Palace===
With his contract at Charlton ending at the end of that season, Ambrose was free to leave the club, and decided to remain in South London, joining [[South London derby|local rivals]] [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. He set a career-best record of 12 goals in 20 games by November, a run that saw him named as the division's Player of the Month for the November.<ref name = "POTM">{{Cite news |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/ambrose-named-player-of-the-month-20091205_2248204_1896064 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091208133609/http://www.football-league.co.uk/championship/news/ambrose-named-player-of-the-month-20091205_2248204_1896064 |title=Ambrose named Player of the Month |date=5 December 2009 |archivedate=8 December 2009 |publisher=The Football League}}</ref> Ambrose ended the season with a goal against [[Sheffield Wednesday]] that saved the club from relegation and subsequently from extinction as well. He finished the season with 20 goals in all competitions. With Crystal Palace in administration, it was looking certain that Ambrose was going to leave at the end of the season, and was set to join [[Queens Park Rangers]], but he signed a new three-year contract with Crystal Palace on 26 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~2102768,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100916082500/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/News/0,,10323~2102768,00.html |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C |title=Ambrose signs new Eagles deal |date=30 July 2010 |archivedate=16 September 2010}}</ref>

In the 2011–12 season, Ambrose was again more of a squad player, featuring more from the bench than his first season at Palace. On 30 November 2011, in his 99th game in all competitions for Crystal Palace, Ambrose scored a 35 yard long range shot at Old Trafford and then got an assist for [[Glenn Murray]]'s goal in the 2–1 win over Manchester United in the League Cup quarter final.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/70292/manchester-united-vs-crystal-palace/report |title=Manchester United 1–2 Crystal Palace (AET): Ambrose wonderstrike & Murray winner dump weakened hosts out of League Cup |author=Shahid, Omar |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2013 |publisher=goal.com}}</ref>

On 13 July 2012, Ambrose signed a two-year contract with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for an undisclosed fee, reported by [[BBC Sport]] to be in the region of £250,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18826706 |title=Birmingham City sign Darren Ambrose from Crystal Palace |date=13 July 2012|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref> He scored on his competitive debut on 14 August, in the 5–1 defeat of [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-5-barnet-1-190359 |title=Birmingham City 5 Barnet 1 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |first=Colin |last=Tattum |date=15 August 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> and kept his place for the opening match of the [[2012–13 Football League]] season, in a 1–1 draw at home to former club Charlton Athletic.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19221628 |title=Birmingham 1–1 Charlton |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> He labelled his contribution to a poor team display in a 5–0 home defeat to [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in September as "the worst performance of my career".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-darren-ambrose-reveals-4910 |title=Birmingham City: Darren Ambrose reveals his and Blues' hurt |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |first=Colin |last=Tattum |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}</ref> Following that game, Ambrose picked up a knee injury which kept him out for most of the season,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} in which he made just six league appearances.<ref name=sb1213/>

After making only two appearances for Birmingham early in the 2013–14 season,<ref name=sb1314/> Ambrose joined [[Greek Superleague]] club [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon Smyrni]] on 14 January 2014, on loan until the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20140113-darren-ambrose-makes-greek-move-1291978.aspx |title=Darren Ambrose makes Greek move |first=Andy |last=Walker |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> He made his debut two days later, in the starting eleven as his club progressed to the quarter-finals of the [[2013–14 Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] on aggregate after a 1–0 second-leg defeat to [[Niki Volou]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20140116-loan-watch-darren-ambrose-1299257.aspx |title=Loan watch&nbsp;– Darren Ambrose |first=Andy |last=Walker |publisher=Birmingham City F.C |date=16 January 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> In his second league match, Ambrose scored a late equaliser to earn a draw away to [[Levadiakos]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite5_1_05/02/2014_537131 |title=Moyes watches Olympiakos produce little as it beat Panionios |first=George |last=Georgakopoulos |newspaper=Ekatherimini |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> He finished the [[2013–14 Superleague Greece|Superleague season]] with six goals from eleven games, but his contribution was not enough to save the team from relegation.<ref name=Soccerway/>

On his return from loan, Birmingham confirmed he would be released when his contract expired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcfc.com/news/article/20140509-paul-robinson-and-olly-lee-extend-blues-stay-as-six-depart-1544099.aspx |title=Paul Robinson and Olly Lee extend Blues stay as six depart |first=Andy |last=Walker |publisher=Birmingham City F.C. |date=10 May 2014 |accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref>

===Ipswich Town (3rd spell)===
Ambrose re-signed for Ipswich Town on 11 September 2014. Ambrose had twice featured for Ipswich's U21 side before putting pen to paper on a new contract. Ambrose, who will wear the number 29 shirt, joins [[John Wark]], [[Tommy Miller]], [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] and [[Daryl Murphy]] as one of a select few players to have had three or more spells with the Blues.

'''Gabriele Ambrosetti''' (born 7 August 1973) is a former [[Football in Italy|Italian football]]er who played as a winger.

Born in [[Varese]], he played for several Italian sides, including [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] and [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]]. He won the [[1996–97 Coppa Italia]] at Vicenza,<ref>{{cite web

He arrived as, according to his manager, [[Gianluca Vialli]], the 'Italian [[Ryan Giggs]]', but struggled to live up to the tag and in four years made only a handful of appearances. He made his Chelsea debut as a substitute on 21 August in a 1–0 home win against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], replacing compatriot [[Gianfranco Zola]] for the last three minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Games played by Gabriele Ambrosetti in 1999/2000|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=14102&season_id=129|publisher=[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>  The only goal he scored for Chelsea was in a 5–0 win against [[Galatasaray S.K.

'''Marco Ambrosio''' (30 May 1973 in [[Brescia]]) is a former Italian [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. Ambrosio played for multiple teams in the Italian leagues from 1991 until his retirement in 2009 (most notably with [[Serie A]] sides [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] and [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]]), but also had brief spells in England with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and in Switzerland with [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshopper]]. He made two appearances for his country's [[Italy national under-21 football team|under-21 side]] during the 1993&ndash;94 season, but never made an appearance for the full national side.

==Football career==

===A Decade in Italy===
The early years of Ambrosio's career were relatively undistinguished, and saw him play for a succession of minor Italian clubs, such as [[A.C. Lumezzane|Lumezzane]] ([[Serie D]]), [[Atalanta B.C.]] (youth), [[Pisa Calcio|Pisa]] ([[Serie B]]), [[A.C. Prato]] ([[Serie C1]]) and [[Ravenna Calcio|Ravenna]] ([[Serie C1]]). Whilst playing for Pisa, he made two appearances for [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy's under-21 team]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=1209&squadra=1 |title=Marco Ambrosio |publisher=Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> He also had a stint with [[U.C. Sampdoria]] in [[Serie A]]. He made his Serie A debut on 2 November 1997, Sampdoria lost 0–3 at home to [[A.C. Milan]]. In total, he played 10 Serie A  games for the [[Genoa|Genoese]] team, as second goalkeeper behind [[Fabrizio Ferron]].

After Sampdoria were relegated to Serie B, Ambrosio was sold to Serie C1 team [[A.S. Lucchese-Libertas|Lucchese]] in the summer of 1999, where he spent two seasons. In summer 2001 he was signed by newly promoted Serie A team [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]], where he made another 10 Serie A appearances as second-choice goalkeeper behind [[Cristiano Lupatelli]].

===Chelsea===
In June 2003 he was signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] on a free [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] by Italian manager [[Claudio Ranieri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=72689.html|title=Ambrosio revels in Chelsea move|date=1 June 2003|accessdate=3 April 2008|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref>

Ambrosio was signed to be goalkeeping understudy to [[Carlo Cudicini]] and fellow new-acquisition [[Jurgen Macho]], and so found his playing opportunities limited at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. His cause was not helped by an unlucky debut in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], in which he made a series of errors.<ref>{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3204843.stm
|title=Chelsea 4-2 Notts County
|publisher=BBC
|date=29 October 2003 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> His second appearance, against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], proved far more assured as he made a string of impressive saves to secure a crucial 2–0 win for his side.<ref>{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3536375.stm
|title=Bolton 0-2 Chelsea
|publisher=BBC
|date=13 March 2004 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> That, together with injuries to all Chelsea's other goalkeepers, earned him a run in the side. His most significant contribution came in the Champions League quarter-final against Arsenal when his saves helped Chelsea to a 2–1 victory at Highbury.<ref>{{cite news

|title=Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea
|publisher=BBC
|date=6 April 2004 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref>

However, he lost his place in the side to the fit-again Cudicini towards the end of the season and with the signing of another new goalkeeper [[Petr Čech]], he was allowed to leave the club on a free transfer in August 2004.

===Return to Italy===
He moved to [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side [[Grasshopper Club Zürich]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=214823.html|title=Grasshoppers chance for Ambrosio|date=11 August 2004|accessdate=3 April 2008|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref> shortly afterward and has since signed for Italian team [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] of Serie B on 5 January 2005, replaced [[Alex Brunner]] who left for [[Cagliari Calcio]], compete with former starter [[Domenico Botticella]].

Ambrosio followed the team relegated to Serie C1 and compete with former teammate in Chievo, [[Gioacchino Cavaliere]]

On 21 July 2006, he was signed by [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]].

In summer 2007, he joined [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]] of [[Serie C2]].

In 2009, Ambrosio retired from football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetinted.com/category/first-team/5125/#.UpTAeMRtHpI |title=The House That Ranieri Built Pt 1: This Ones For 'Keeps |publisher=Blue Tinted |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

'''Samuel Oluwaseyi J. "Sammy" Ameobi''' (born 1 May 1992) is a [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] as a [[winger (sports)|winger]]. He is the younger brother of fellow players [[Shola Ameobi|Shola]] and [[Tomi Ameobi]].

==Club career==

===Newcastle United===

====Early career====
Born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Tyne and Wear,<ref name="NUFCProfile" /> Ameobi joined the [[Newcastle United F.C.

==Club career==

===Newcastle United===
====Early career====
Ameobi signed a pre-contract with Newcastle on 1 July 1997.<ref name=NUFC/> He progressed through the youth setup, making his debut in the reserves in 1998 on 11 October against Sunderland. He made his first team debut two years later, 9 September 2000, in a home game against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref name=NUFC/> He went on to make 22 appearances for Newcastle that season,<ref name=NUFC/> in lieu of the injured [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Carl Cort]].<ref name=NUFC/>

The 2002–03 Champions League saw some of Ameobi's finest performances including an equalising goal against [[FC Barcelona]] in a 3–1 defeat at the [[Nou Camp]]<ref>{{cite news|date=11 Dec 2002

His erratic form has earned him some criticism in the past, and although never having been claimed as a prolific goalscorer, many of his games were [[substitute (association football)|as a substitute]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Due to injuries in the latter stages of the [[FA Premier League 2005–06|2005–06 season]], Ameobi gained a regular starting place, and scored six goals in Newcastle's last 12 Premier League games.{{cn|date=October 2010}}

In the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2006|2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup]], Ameobi scored twice in Newcastle's away tie at [[Lillestrøm SK]] (3–0),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5203392.stm|title=L'strom 0–3 Newcastle (agg 1–4)|publisher=BBC Sport

====Injury, loan, and transfer attempts====
During the 2006–07 season, Ameobi needed a [[hip]] operation, a problem which had been plaguing him for two seasons. Newcastle's shortage of match-fit first team strikers during the previous season had forced him to postpone this surgery.<ref>{{cite news|date=25 October 2006|url= http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2393270,00.html|author=Alex Dunn|title=Shola set for hip op|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=20 October 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090112092822/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2393270,00.html|archivedate=12 January 2009}}</ref> The problem eventually forced [[Glenn Roeder]] to send Ameobi for surgery two months before the transfer window, making the 0–0 draw away game to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] his last game and ruling him out for the rest of the season.{{cn|date=October 2010}} He had made 13 appearances (three as a substitute) and scored five goals.{{cn|date=October 2010}}

Ameobi and the Newcastle medical team reported his hip operation in the United States was a success and that the club doctors and medical staff would work on his rehabilitation.{{cn|date=October 2010}} It was originally thought that he would not be fit to play until the start of the [[FA Premier League 2007–08|2007–08 season]], but his rehabilitation progressed quickly and he returned with three games remaining in the season, clocking approximately 30 minutes of match action against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]<ref>{{cite news|date=1 May 2007|url= http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2454991,00.html|author=James Pearson|title=Ameobi thrilled to return|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=20 October 2008|archivedate=12 January 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090112091809/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_2454991,00.html}}</ref> and making a further two appearances.

However, after failing to impress Newcastle manager [[Sam Allardyce]],<ref>{{cite news|date=21 January 2008|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_3067108,00.html|title=Ameobi grabs Keegan lifeline|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=20 October 2008}}</ref> or [[Kevin Keegan]]<ref>{{cite news|date=15 February 2008|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3148652,00.html

It is understood that a loan fee of around £500K was agreed and that a possible permanent transfer was also discussed subject to Stoke winning promotion.<ref>{{cite news

After playing for six games and not managing to score despite Stoke's gaining of promotion, Ameobi returned to Newcastle, and Stoke decided not to sign him permanently.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_3537502,00.html|author=Chris Burton|title=Potters deny Ameobi deal|publisher=Sky Sports|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=20 October 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090112160421/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_3537502,00.html|archivedate=12 January 2009}}</ref>

On 14 August, [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] manager [[Jim Magilton]] confirmed that the club were in talks with Ameobi and that the club were keen to get the deal finalised as long as Ameobi was willing to play in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. However, on 17 August, Ameobi failed a medical, showing hamstring problems, and the deal collapsed.<ref>{{cite news|date=19 August 2008|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_4012544,00.html|title=Injury halts Ameobi move|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=20 October 2008|archivedate=12 January 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090112092650/http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_4012544,00.html}}</ref>

====Later career====
In the 2011–12 season, Ameobi became something of a fringe player, with the arrival of [[Demba Ba]] and later, [[Papiss Cissé]], pushing him onto the substitutes bench. But on Sunday 16 October 2011, against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]], Ameobi, a 71st-minute substitute for [[Leon Best]], scored a goal late on to make it 2–2. The next few games were an annoyance for Ameobi, with Ba finding his shooting boots and pairing well with Best and with Ameobi's inclusion in the starting line-up against Norwich ending up in a 4–2 defeat. On 4 March, Ameobi was yet again on the bench for a game against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and brought on as a substitute for Cissé he scored a 91st-minute equaliser to get Newcastle back on terms and bringing his tally to 7 goals in 12 games against Sunderland for Newcastle, a record only bettered by [[Jackie Milburn]]. His prolific goal scoring form against Sunderland has led many sections of the Newcastle support to refer to him as "The Mackem Slayer".<ref>{{cite web|title=As derby hero Ameobi prepares for his last Tyne-Wear clash, is the 'Mackem Slayer' set for one final act of Black Cat savagery?|author=Craig Hope|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=31 January 2014|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2549894/Shola-Ameobi-known-Mackem-Slayer-add-goals-Newcastle-against-Sunderland-Tyne-Wear-derby.html |work=[[Mail Online]]|archivedate=21 July 2014|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140721055009/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2549894/Shola-Ameobi-known-Mackem-Slayer-add-goals-Newcastle-against-Sunderland-Tyne-Wear-derby.html}}</ref> His next league goal came nine months later, in a 1–0 win over [[Queen's Park Rangers|QPR]] on 22 December.

'''Daniel Owefin Amokachi''' (born 30 December 1972 in [[Kaduna]]) is a [[Nigeria]]n former professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] of [[Idoma people|Idoma]] descent and assistant manager of the [[Nigeria national football team]].

As a player he was a [[striker]] from 1989 until 2005, starting his career with [[Ranchers Bees]] before earning notability by playing outside his native country with [[Premier League]] side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], as well as [[Club Brugge]] and [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] before initially finishing his career in the [[United States]] with [[Major League Soccer]] club [[Colorado Rapids]]. He returned to Nigeria in 2005 to briefly play for [[Nasarawa United F.C.|Nasarawa United]], who he went on to manage before moving on to [[Enyimba International F.C.|Enyimba]]. He is now in his second spell as assistant manager of [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]].

== Playing career ==
Amokachi, nicknamed "The Bull"  was discovered while playing for Ranchers Bee by Nigerian national team coach [[Clemens Westerhof]], who brought the talented player to the [[1990 African Nations Cup]], and soon Amokachi moved to play for [[Club Brugge]] in [[Belgium]]. He competed in the new format of the Champions League, and became the first player to score in the competition, after his goal secured a 1–0 win in the opening match in the group stage against [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]]. Performing well in Belgium and at the 1994 World Cup, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] became interested in Amokachi and their manager [[Mike Walker (football manager)|Mike Walker]] signed him for a fee of £3,000,000 ($4,700,000).

He went on to win the [[FA Cup]] with Everton in 1995, famously infuriating manager [[Joe Royle]] by bringing himself on as a substitute then proceeding to score two goals in the semi-final against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He appeared in the final only briefly, late on, as a substitute but is remembered fondly for his beret wearing celebrations.

He remained at Everton until the end of the [[1995-96 in English football|1995–96 season]], when he was transferred to [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] of [[Turkey]] for a fee of £1.75million. He had failed to make the impact at [[Goodison Park]] that many fans had been hoping for, and had been unable to win a regular place in the first team, as [[Paul Rideout]] and [[Duncan Ferguson (footballer)|Duncan Ferguson]] were firmly established as Everton's two strikers at this stage. He did, however, stand in for Ferguson while he spent six weeks in prison during the autumn of 1995 for an offence committed in [[Scotland]] 18 months earlier.

{{MedalSport | Men's [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Football]]}}
{{MedalGold | [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta]] | [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Team Competition]]}}
{{MedalBottom}}
He played many international matches for [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and was part of the team that participated in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and won the [[1994 African Nations Cup]]. He also helped win the Olympic gold medal in [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], scoring in the Gold Medal game itself against Argentina.

Amokachi sustained an injury just ahead of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], played one game, but struggled with knee problems thereafter. After leaving Beşiktaş in 1999, his playing career more or less ended. He signed with [[1860 Munich]], but the contract was cancelled after he failed a medical test. In turn he was rejected by [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] for the same reason. Amokachi trained with French second division side [[US Créteil]], but the deal was hampered by injuries. American [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] team [[Colorado Rapids]] signed him in 2002, but seeing as he was not fit enough they released him before a single match was played. He went to play in the [[United Arab Emirates]], but was denied again due to his medical condition.

== Managerial career ==
Amokachi managed Nigerian club [[Nasarawa United F.C.]] and later [[Enyimba Aba]]. In April 2007 he quit his role as assistant coach of the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria national team]]. On 10 April 2008 Amokachi was re-appointed to Nigeria's national team, the Super Eagles, as assistant coach to [[Shuaibu Amodu]], also being assistant manager to [[Stephen Keshi]].

As early as 2006, Amorebieta expressed his interest in playing for the [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuelan national team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/athletic/es/desarrollo/720825.html|title=Fernando Amorebieta dispuesto a jugar ya con Venezuela|trans_title=Fernando Amorebieta willing to play for Venezuela immediately|publisher=Marca|language=Spanish|date=19 December 2006|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> However, according to [[FIFA]] rules at the time, he should have switched his affiliation prior to the age of 21, having previously played for Spain's youth teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archivo.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/athletic/es/desarrollo/730290.html|title=Fernando Amorebieta no podrá jugar con la selección de Venezuela como quería|trans_title=Fernando Amorebieta will not be able to play with Venezuelan national team as he intended|publisher=Marca|language=Spanish|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> FIFA removed the rule in 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=652502&cc=5739|title=Age limit on players switching nations is removed|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=4 June 2009|accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> and talks between the player and the [[Venezuelan Football Federation]] resumed.

'''Lorenzo Pier Luigi Amoruso''' (born 28 June 1971) is a retired [[Italians|Italian]] [[Association football|footballer]] who played for seven teams during his footballing career but is perhaps best known for his six-year spell with [[Glasgow]] side [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In that six-year spell, he managed to win nine major honours with the club including domestic trebles in seasons 1998–99 and 2002–03, representing them over 150 times in competitive football.

==Club career==

===Italy===
He began his career at local club, [[A.S. Bari|Bari]], in 1988, for whom he went on to make 75 appearances, scoring 8 goals. Amoruso spent 1991-1993 on loan at [[Mantova Calcio|Mantova]] and [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]], but only featured intermittently. In 1995 he secured a move to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], becoming club captain and making 54 appearances. He won the [[Coppa Italia]] in 1996 and in 1997 the Florence side went on a remarkable run in Europe where they reached the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]] only to lose out to eventual champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.serieaweekly.com/2012/01/player-profile-lorenzo-amoruso.html | title=Player Profile: Lorenzo Amoruso | accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

===Rangers===
Following interest from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-231566/Everton-chasing-Souness.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Jeff | last=Powell | title=Everton chasing Souness | date=30 May 1997}}</ref> Amoruso signed for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on 29 May 1997 for a fee of [[£]]4&nbsp;million. Whilst with the club he won the [[Scottish Premier League]] on three occasions, as well as the Scottish Cup three times and the Scottish League Cup three times. After missing most of his debut season with an Achilles tendon injury, he was installed as captain of Rangers by [[Dick Advocaat]] in 1998. After returning to the team Amoruso was booed by Rangers fans after several poor displays and tactical errors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GO+EASY+ON+THE+AMO%3b+Gough+spares+a+thought+for+Lorenzo%27s+toil.%28Sport%29-a060933194|title=GO EASY ON THE AMO; Gough spares a thought for Lorenzo's toil|date=3 November 1998 |publisher=Daily Record|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> Amoruso also clashed with the manager several times, resulting in an eventually aborted move to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. Advocaat began to sign defenders to replace Amoruso, [[Bert Konterman]] for example and also [[Paul Ritchie (footballer born 1975)|Paul Ritchie]], but the [[Italy|Italian]] remained after his replacements failed. [[Paul Ritchie (footballer born 1975)|Ritchie]] did not make a single appearance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-18753147.html|title=Ritchie the Maine attraction puts Ibrox flop behind him|date=9 September 2000 |publisher=The Scotsman|author=Mike Wade|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> while [[Bert Konterman|Konterman]] was criticised – particularly by his own fans – for being an expensive signing with minimal returns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Advocaat%27s+defence+of+A+SQUAD+THAT+just+can%27t+meet+great...-a0109683006|title=Advocaat's defence of A SQUAD THAT just can't meet great EXPECTATIONS; Reality check needed if you believe Rangers can be Europe's best|date=9 December 2000 |publisher=The Daily Mail|author=Peter Jardine|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-72599947.html|title=Football: BERT GETS A BASHING; Rangers 0 Dundee 2 Utd Fans go mad at top flop|date=21 April 2001 |author=David Leggit|publisher=The People|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref>

In December 1999, Amoruso issued a public apology after directing racist comments at [[Borussia Dortmund]]'s Nigerian striker [[Victor Ikpeba]].<ref>{{cite news

In the [[Rangers F.C. season 2000–01|2000–01 season]], when Rangers exited the [[UEFA Champions League]] to [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] partly because of another bad mistake by Amoruso, he was stripped of the captaincy (which went to the 22-year-old [[Barry Ferguson]]). Amoruso had captained the club for two years, the first ever Catholic to do so.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+MY+HEART+WILL+ALWAYS+BE+AT+GERS%3b+Big+Amo+signs+off.%28Sport%29-a0105290758|title=Football: MY HEART WILL ALWAYS BE AT GERS; Big Amo signs off|date=13 July 2003 |publisher=Sunday Mail|author=Mark Guidi|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> He was left humiliated<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-94312194.html FOOTBALL: Advocaat tore off armband and ripped out my heart; ADAPTED from LA CONFIDENTIAL: The Lorenzo Amoruso Story by David McCarthy and Keith Jackson priced pounds 9.99]</ref> by the demotion and later accused Advocaat of trying to destroy him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cover+story%3a+It+would%27ve+been+hard+to+play+for+a+gaffer+who+set+out...-a0123553304|title=It would've been hard to play for a gaffer who set out to destroy me|date=24 October 2004 |publisher=Sunday Mail|author=Mark Guidi|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref>

After [[Dick Advocaat]]'s October 2000 attack on what he described as "fat necks" in his squad, reports named the Italian as a probable target.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rangers need to be hungry again|date=24 October 2000 |publisher=The Daily Mail|author=Peter Jardine|accessdate=29 June 2010}}</ref> More errors had seen Amoruso again booed by his own teams' supporters.<ref name=blooper>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+THE+SEVEN+DEADLY+SINS+OF+LORENZO.%28Sport%29-a068201843|title=Football: THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS OF LORENZO |accessdate=10 July 2010 |author=Colin Duncan|publisher=Daily Record|date=13 December 2000}}</ref>
 
Advocaat was later removed as manager and Amoruso rediscovered his form under new boss [[Alex McLeish]]; winning the 2002 [[Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year]]. After a four-match ban for spitting on [[James Grady]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Amoruso-banned-for-four-games.2411750.jp|title=Amoruso banned for four games for spitting |accessdate=10 July 2010 |author=Stephen Halliday|publisher=The Scotsman|date=19 March 2003}}</ref> he scored the winning goal in his final game for Rangers—the 2003 [[Scottish Cup 2002–03|Scottish Cup]] final—and wept as he left the pitch.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Amoruso left Rangers in July 2003 to make a £1.4&nbsp;million move to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]],<ref>{{Cite news

On the pitch for the full ninety minutes, his place in the team appeared justified as he scored the opening goal after 17 minutes. In October, a knee injury kept him out of the game for five months, which, coming at the end of a run of bad form, was somewhat of a boost. As he returned and came into the team on a sporadic basis playing only eighteen times for Blackburn. His [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season was marred by regular injuries and he did not play any part of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season. He was released by Rovers in the summer of 2006.

In January 2008, Amoruso briefly came out of retirement to sign for [[S.S. Cosmos|Cosmos]] of [[San Marino]] on a part-time basis.<ref name="S.S. Cosmos">{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=658233.html|title=Cosmos starstruck by Amoruso arrival|publisher=[[UEFA]] website|date=14 February 2008}}</ref>

==International career==
Amoruso represented [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship]] and won two caps at Under 21 level.

He was never selected by [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at full international level, which Amoruso attributed to a "strange mentality" pervading his homeland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+AMO+IS+CUP+AGAINST+IT+FOR+A+CAP.-a082940659|title=Football: AMO IS CUP AGAINST IT FOR A CAP|publisher=Sunday Mail|date=17 February 2002}}</ref> He blamed [[Giovanni Trapattoni]], [[Cesare Maldini]] and [[Dino Zoff]] for failing to provide him with the call-up he felt he deserved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+AMO%3a+BOB+CAN+DO+A+JOB+AFTER+HIS+CAP+CALL-UP.-a097372559|title=AMO: BOB CAN DO A JOB AFTER HIS CAP CALL-UP|publisher=Sunday Mail|date=9 February 2003}}</ref>

In 2004 Amoruso expressed a desire to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], through residency. He said: "I began to feel like part of me was Scottish."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3a+Blackburn+star%3a+I+may+give+Vogts+more+Amo.-a0113344682|title=Blackburn star: I may give Vogts more Amo|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=17 February 2004}}</ref>

After the game, his parents told him that a [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ben Amos - Quote, Unquote |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Ben-Amos.aspx?section=Quote |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |accessdate=22 April 2011 }}</ref> Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11.<ref name="pfa"/>

===Manchester United===
In his first season at Manchester United, Amos became a regular starter for the club's Under-13 team, playing in 19 out of 27 matches in the 2001–02 season.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Cliff |editor1-last=Butler |editor2-first=Ivan |editor2-last=Ponting |title=Manchester United Official Yearbook 2002 |year=2002 |publisher=Carlton Books |location=London |isbn=0-233-05016-7 |pages=207–210 }}</ref> Amos was named as an unused substitute for the Under-18 side for the first time on 8 January 2005, for a league game against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. His first appearance for the Under-18s came exactly nine months later, on 8 October 2005, coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Danny Rose (footballer born 1988)|Danny Rose]] after starting goalkeeper [[Ron-Robert Zieler]] was sent off in a 2–0 defeat to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. He was regularly named as an unused substitute during the 2005–06 season – including for two [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] matches – but became a frequent starter for the Under-18s in 2006–07 after signing a trainee contract in July 2006.<ref>{{cite web |first=Olav |last=Ree |title=Ben Amos |url=http://www.gethome.no/redstat/?PlayerNo=1208 |publisher=redStat |accessdate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> However, he missed the final of the 2006–07 [[FA Youth Cup]] with a [[dislocated shoulder]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Mathieson |title=United kids can make Paul proud |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1005/1005518_united_kids_can_make_paul_proud_.html |work=Manchester Evening News |publisher=MEN Media |date=26 April 2007 |accessdate=11 July 2011 }}</ref>

He retained his place in the Under-18 team for 2007–08, in addition to making his debut for the reserve team against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] on 7 November 2007, and during the season he impressed enough to be selected to go on the first-team's 2008 summer tour of [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Reds head to South Africa |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2008/Jul/Reds-head-to-South-Africa.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 July 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2011 }}</ref> Amos was named as a substitute for all three matches of the tour, but did not play.

'''Stephan Maigaard Andersen''' (born 26 November 1981) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[association football|football]] player, who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Danish Superliga]] side [[F.C. Copenhagen]]. He is also a full international for the [[Denmark national football team]] and was chosen to represent his country at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

==Club career==

===Early years===
Starting his career at the youth teams of [[Hvidovre IF]], he moved youth setup of multiple Danish champions [[Brøndby IF]]. When he was no longer seen as a long-term prospect for the Brøndby goalkeeping position, he left Brøndby in the winter 1999, to rejoin Hvidovre. Andersen made his senior debut for [[Hvidovre IF]] in the lower league [[Danish 1st Division]], and was recognized as a big talent.

===AB===
In March 2002, Hvidovre owner, and professional goalkeeper, [[Peter Schmeichel]] chose to end his engagement in the club. Hvidovre actively sought to off-load Andersen, one of only two professional players in the squad. He was initially wanted by a number of clubs in [[Football in England|English football]], including Schmeichel's club [[Aston Villa FC]] and [[Sunderland AFC]], the club of Danish international goalkeeper [[Thomas Sørensen]]. Sunderland opted to buy [[Norway national football team|Norwegian international]] goalkeeper [[Thomas Myhre]] instead, and no other foreign offers materialized. Andersen moved to [[Akademisk Boldklub]] (AB) in the top-flight [[Danish Superliga]] championship in August 2002.

===Charlton Athletic===
He moved abroad to join English club [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in a [[Danish krone|DKK]] 8 million [[transfer deal]] in June 2004.<ref name="brondbyswitch">Charlton Athletic (29 November 2006). [http://www.cafc.co.uk/newsview.ink?nid=30022 "Andersen set for Brondby switch"] cafc.co.uk (accessed 29 November 2006)</ref> In his first season with the London club, he only made two first team appearances. Due to an injury sustained by first choice goalkeeper [[Dean Kiely]], Andersen started the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005–06 season]] in the team. Charlton's poor mid-season form saw him dropped in favour of Kiely at first, then Thomas Myhre, who established himself as first choice as Charlton turned their season around. Andersen was reinstated into the lineup for the last two games of the season, when Myhre suffered an injury. In the 2006 summer [[transfer window]], Andersen looked ready to join [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] on a season-long [[loan (football)|loan deal]],<ref name=BBC1>BBC.co.uk (31 August 2006). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/5304288.stm "Andersen makes Leeds loan switch"] bbc.co.uk (accessed 1 September 2006)</ref> but as Charlton insisted on a clause to allow the club to recall Andersen at any time during the season, the transfer fell through at the last moment.<ref name=SKYSP1>Sky Sports (1 September 2006). [http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=413557&CPID=10&clid=2&lid=4&title=Leeds+loan+collapses "Leeds loan collapses"] SkySports.com (accessed 1 September 2006)</ref> In the first half of the [[FA Premier League 2006-07|2006–07 season]], he saw the loaned-in [[Scott Carson]] become Charlton's starting goalkeeper.

===Brøndby IF===
In November 2006, Andersen signed a transfer deal to move back to Denmark to play for Superliga side [[Brøndby IF]] at the start of the January 2007 [[transfer window]].<ref name="brondbyswitch"/> He made some errors in his first time at the club, dropping against [[Odense Boldklub]]<ref>http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/fodbold/udenlandsk_fodbold/international_fodbold/article157380.ece</ref> and [[Viborg FF]],<ref>http://avisen.dk/broendby-vandt-trods-drop_72735.aspx</ref> but was kept in the starting line-up and eventually upped his game. He helped Brøndby win the 2008 [[Danish Cup]],<ref>http://www.haslund.info/danmark/pt/200708/fina.asp</ref> and was named 2008 [[Det Gyldne Bur|Danish ''Goalkeeper of the Year'']].

===Later career===
[[File:Stephan Andersen.JPG|thumb|Andersen (right) training at Évian, 2012.]]
In August 2011 he joined former teammate [[Daniel Wass]] at [[Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C.|Évian]] in the French [[Ligue 1]] for a fee of DKK 2 million.<ref>http://onside.dk/nyheder/superligaen/avis-sa-meget-far-bif-for-stephan-a</ref><ref>http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=67599</ref> In the summer of 2013 he signed a two-year contract with [[Real Betis]] of the Spanish [[La Liga]]. He was sent on loan to Dutch [[Eredivisie]] side [[Go Ahead Eagles]] on 30 January 2014 for the remainder of the 2013-14 season. On 19 May 2014 it was announced he would return to Denmark on a permanent deal, signing a three year contract with [[Danish Superliga|Superliga]] side [[FC Copenhagen]], the main rivals of his previous club Brøndby. <ref>http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/superliga/officielt-stephan-andersen-til-fc-koebenhavn</ref>

==International career==
[[File:NED-DEN Euro 2012 (22).jpg|thumb|left|Andersen with [[Wesley Sneijder]] of the Netherlands at  Euro 2012. He kept a clean sheet as Denmark won 1-0.]]
Andersen was called up for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Danish under-21 national team]] in June 2001, where he immediately displaced the two-years older [[Rune Pedersen (footballer)|Rune Pedersen]]. While at AB, he reached 21 games for the Danish under-21 national team, and was the first goalkeeper to win a Danish talent award, when he was named 2003 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish ''under-21 Talent of the Year'']].

Following strong displays for AB, Andersen made his Danish national team debut against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in a March 2004 [[friendly match]]. It would be four-and-a-half years before he got his second cap. He was selected as a backup goalkeeper for the Danish national team squad at the 2004 European Championship, where Thomas Sørensen was preferred as the starting goalkeeper in every game. While playing for Brøndby, Andersen got his second cap in September 2008, and replaced the injured Thomas Sørensen for three games in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. He was included in the Danish squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]tournament. After the injured [[Thomas Sørensen]] was ruled out of [[UEFA Euro 2012]], Andersen replaced him as the first-choice goalkeeper for the Danish national team.

==Club career==
Andersen was born in [[Kristiansund]] and played for [[Clausenengen FK|Clausenengen]] before he joined [[Molde FK|Molde]] ahead of the [[1995 Norwegian Premier League|1995 season]].<ref>[http://www.playerhistory.com/player/2371 Trond Andersen] on [[Playerhistory.com]] {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> He played for the [[Tippeligaen]] side until the summer of 1999, when he was sold to [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], right before Molde's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] matches against [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]]. Molde's head coach [[Erik Brakstad]] stated in 2011 that if the club had not sold their best player (Andersen), Molde could have advanced from the group stage of [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fotball.rbnett.no/eliteserien/article214101.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Brakstad tror Molde kan overraske i Europa |publisher=[[Romsdals Budstikke]] |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

After playing for Wimbledon for four seasons, Andersen moved to [[Denmark]] to play for [[AaB Fodbold|Aalborg]] in the [[Danish Superliga]] in 2003, before being bought by rivals [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in September 2005. In April 2006, he suffered a knee injury. As he had not recovered by March 2007, Andersen considered retiring from the game.

==International career==

Anderson began his career with [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]], joining the youth team before rising through the ranks. His goal against [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe|Náutico]] during the [[Batalha dos Aflitos (2005)|2005 play-offs]] gained Grêmio promotion to the [[Brazilian Série A]]. Before the start of the 2005–06 season, Anderson moved to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], gaining first team status during his two seasons with them. There, he won the [[Portuguese Liga]] twice, along with the [[Taça de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]] and [[Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira|SuperCup]] during 2005–06. He moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] before the 2007–08 season, and has won the Premier League three times, the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].

Anderson made his [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] debut in 2007 during the [[Copa América 2007|2007 Copa América]], which they went on to win. He also played for the [[Brazil Olympic football team]] during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], helping them secure the bronze medal.

==Club career==

===Grêmio===
Born in [[Porto Alegre]], Anderson joined [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] as a youth player. He made his first appearance for the team on 23 October 2004 in a 3–1 loss to Internacional in the [[Brazilian Série A]], in which he scored a goal from a free kick.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Ladyman |title=Anderson story is a fairy-tale after his grim start |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-459253/Anderson-story-fairy-tale-grim-start.html |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=1 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Brazilian League 2004 |url=http://www.gremio.net/page/view.aspx?i=id_865&language=1 |work=Gremio.net |publisher=Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense |accessdate=28 July 2011 }}</ref> Grêmio, however, were relegated at the season's conclusion and Anderson followed the team to the [[Brazilian Série B]].

It was reported in June 2005 that Portuguese group [[GestiFute]] had paid €5&nbsp;million for 70% of the economic rights to Anderson. On 18 June 2005, Anderson was reported to have signed a pre-contract with [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/europeu/interna/0,,OI558549-EI2035,00-Anderson+exGremio+acerta+com+o+Porto.html|title=Anderson, ex-Grêmio, acerta com o Porto|date=18 June 2005|accessdate=4 October 2010|work=Terra Brasil|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=310826.html|title=Porto pick up promising Brazilian |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=4 October 2010|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref>

He earned himself iconic status by scoring the goal that lifted Grêmio back into Serie A in a promotion playoff against [[Clube Náutico Capibaribe|Náutico]] in November 2005.<ref name="mu">{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/First-Team/Anderson.aspx |title=Anderson |work=Man Utd.com |accessdate=3 October 2010 }}</ref> This goal was particularly memorable because Grêmio only had seven players on the pitch at the time and had just seen the opposition have a penalty saved.

====2011–12 season====
Anderson started the season curtain-raiser, the [[2011 FA Community Shield]], which resulted in a 3–2 win over [[Manchester City F.C|Manchester City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14420151.stm |title=Man City 2 - 3 Man Utd|author=Chris Bevan |date=7 August 2011 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> He also started the first three games, a 2–1 win against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/14435075.stm |title=West Brom 1-2 Man Utd |author=Saj Chowdhury |date=14 August 2011 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> a 3–0 win against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at home, where he scored his first goal of the season,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14539056.stm |title=Man Utd 3-0 Tottenham |author=Phil McNulty |date=22 August 2011 |work=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> and the 8–2 win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he assisted on [[Danny Welbeck]]'s opening goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14606020.stm |title=Man Utd 8-2 Arsenal |author=Phil McNulty |date=28 August 2011 |work=BBC Sport|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>

Anderson made a surprise return earlier than expected on 31 December 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3–2 home defeat to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Further injuries led to Anderson, however, being sidelined for the remainder of the season.

====2012–13 season====
Anderson returned in the [[2012–13 Manchester United F.C. season|2012–13 season]], an early highlight being the third round [[2012–13 Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on 26 September 2012, when Anderson scored an excellent opener in a 2–1 victory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} He carried his form into the next round of the League Cup on 31 October in a match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

On 1 December 2012, Anderson scored his first league goal of the season in a 4–3 victory away at [[Reading F.C.|Reading]].

====2013–14 season====
After falling out of favour under new Manchester United manager [[David Moyes]], playing just eight games in the first half of the [[2013–14 Manchester United F.C. season|2013–14 season]], Anderson joined Italian club [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] on loan on 18 January 2014 for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Transfer window: Man Utd's Anderson loaned to Fiorentina |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25719015 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2014 }}</ref> During his five-month loan, Anderson only made seven appearances for Fiorentina, three of which were from the bench.

==International career==
In April 2005, Anderson played for Brazil in the South American under-17 Championship.

When Brazil were in trouble of going out of the tournament after their opening game defeat against [[Gambia national football team|Gambia]], Anderson helped to turn their fortunes around in the next match against the Netherlands. Anderson played well against the Dutch, contributing crosses and runs that aided his side. Anderson kept up his level of performance after that, scoring one goal and playing a key role in others, notably setting up Ramon for the first strike against [[Korea DPR national football team|Korea DPR]] in the quarter-final. After helping to lead Brazil into the final after a 4–3 semi-final victory over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], Anderson lasted only 15 minutes of the final with Mexico before being stretchered off.

Anderson made his international debut for the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian senior team]] on 27 June 2007 in their 2–0 loss against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the [[Copa América 2007|2007 Copa América]], coming on as a second-half substitute.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite news |title=Anderson gets Man Utd work permit |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6252368.stm|work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2008 }}</ref> He made his first start for Brazil on 1 July 2007 against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] in a 3–0 victory.

It was reported that Anderson was hospitalised after a serious car crash in Portugal on 31 July 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anderson 'Lucky to Survive' Car Crash ! |url=http://www.united-latest.com/1/post/2010/8/breaking-news-anderson-involved-in-car-crash.html |work=United Latest |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010 }}</ref> He had spent the night before at a nightclub before leaving in his [[Audi R8 (road car)|Audi R8]]. The crash occurred at 7&nbsp;am when the car came off the road and hit a farm wall before entering a field. Anderson was unconscious but was pulled from the car minutes before it exploded. Another man and a woman were also in the car. All three suffered minor injuries and were treated for whiplash, concussion, and shock at a hospital.

==Notes==
:A. {{note|Sbase}} Soccerbase's stats for the match between Nottingham Forest and Derby County on 17 September 2011 fail to count a substitute appearance made by Anderson, instead crediting it to [[Lee Croft]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://origin-www.dcfc.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10270~58108,00.html |title=Nottm Forest 1-2 Derby County |work=dcfc.co.uk |date=17 September 2011|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> Therefore, until and unless they correct it, he ''should'' have one more appearance for Derby than given on his Soccerbase page.

'''Vivian Alexander "Viv" Anderson''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 29 July 1956) is an English [[association football|football]] coach and former player. Born in [[Clifton, Nottingham]], he played for various clubs in [[The Football League]] in the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. He is also notable for being the first [[black people|black]] football player to represent [[England national football team|England]] in a full international match.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/nottingham/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8649000/8649243.stm England's first black international footballer] - BBC News, 11 May 2010</ref>

==Playing career==
===Nottingham Forest===
Anderson had broken into the [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] team during 1974 and became a regular after the arrival of [[Brian Clough]] as manager of the [[East Midlands]] club, then in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], in January 1975. He was part of the side that won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1977, winning the title, along with the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]], a year later.

Anderson was one of the first black players to represent top English clubs at the time, and regularly suffered racial abuse from fans of rival teams. He was regularly pelted with bananas and targeted with racist chants.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Wheeler |title=Viv Anderson Exclusive: Racists were raining down fruit. Brian Clough just said 'get me two pears and a banana' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1269285/Viv-Anderson-Exclusive-Racists-raining-fruit-Brian-Clough-just-said-pears-banana.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |location=London |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2011 }}</ref>

When Anderson received the call-up for England in 1978, coach [[Ron Greenwood]] was insistent that no political issue was at stake, despite the ever rising number of young black stars in the game, born and raised in England. There was no doubt that Anderson was playing outstandingly in a form team that season and got his call-up entirely on merit. A gangly, awkward figure, he was a much-admired tackler and was also quick going forward and occasionally scored vital goals. Vindication for his selection on merit was further supplied when Anderson was part of the Forest team that retained the League Cup and then clinched the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1979 with victory over [[Malmö FF|Malmö]].

All that said, Anderson found himself frequently up against equally competent right-backs when it came to getting regular international recognition. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool's]] much-decorated [[Phil Neal]] was the first-choice right-back as the late 1970s became the 1980s, while [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] captain [[Trevor Cherry]] was also regularly called up. Anderson had to be patient prior to winning his second [[cap (football)|cap]] in a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in June 1979. His third appearance was his first competitive international as England defeated [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 2–0 at Wembley in a qualifier for the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]].

Anderson continued to impress for Forest during this period, and picked up his second European Cup winners' medal when they retained the trophy with victory over [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in [[Madrid]]. Forest did reach a third successive League Cup final that year, but lost to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

England had duly got through to the European Championship finals in Italy and Anderson was named in Greenwood's squad, playing in the final group game against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] as a replacement for Neal. England won 2–1 but did not progress further. Anderson later made his [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] debut in a qualifier for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 competition]] in a 4–0 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]]. Essentially the battle was now between Neal and Anderson for the No. 2 shirt, but after qualification for the World Cup, neither were suddenly appropriate for the role.

Injury to [[Kevin Keegan]] had meant Greenwood needed to call upon an experienced club captain to lead the team out in Spain, so [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town's]] skipper [[Mick Mills]], normally a left-back, was put in the right-back slot (with regular incumbent [[Kenny Sansom]] remaining on the left) and both Neal and Anderson missed out. Neal played against [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] in the final group game to rest Mills when qualification had already been assured, but Mills returned for the second phase, from which England were eliminated. Anderson, meanwhile, never kicked a ball.

With Forest beginning to fall from grace (the ageing side was breaking up and the 1980 European Cup win was to prove to be their last trophy for nine years), Anderson's England career seemed to be stalling. After the World Cup and Greenwood's departure, he did not feature at all under new coach [[Bobby Robson]] until 1984, with Neal still mainly getting the nod. England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1984|1984 European Championships]] during this period.

===Arsenal===
Anderson finally won an 11th cap, in April 1984, almost two years after his tenth. In the same year, he aimed to revive his career with a move to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for [[pound sterling|£]]250,000.<ref name="Wednesday Boys">{{cite book |first1=Jason |last1=Dickinson |first2=John |last2=Brodie |title=The Wednesday Boys: A Definitive Who's Who of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club 1880–2005 |pages=3–4 |publisher=Pickard Communication |location=Sheffield |year=2005 |isbn=0-9547264-9-9 }}</ref> This duly helped Anderson revitalise his international standing and he won six consecutive caps from 1984 and into 1985, including four qualifiers for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico; in the first of which he scored his first of his two international goals in an 8–0 mauling of [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. Then Robson gave a debut to the young [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] right-back [[Gary M. Stevens|Gary Stevens]] who was so impressive that Anderson found himself usurped again. Robson split his selection policy, but Stevens got slightly more appearances than Anderson as England completed their qualification for Mexico and though both were in the squad for the finals, it was clear that Anderson was again going as reserve.

Stevens played every minute of England's tournament as a [[Diego Maradona]]-inspired [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] disposed of them in the quarter finals. Again, Anderson had travelled to a World Cup without kicking a ball. Anderson became the second outfield England player, after [[George Eastham]] in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]], to have attended two World Cup tournaments and not got on the pitch at either. Only [[Martin Keown]] (in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]) and three goalkeepers ([[Chris Woods]], [[Nigel Martyn]] and [[David James (footballer)|David James]]) have since equalled this record.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Anderson won three caps at the end of 1986 as England began their quest to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988 European Championships]] in Germany. In one of the qualifiers against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], Anderson scored his second and final international goal.

In 1987, he enjoyed some club success for the first time in seven years when Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2–1 in the League Cup final.

===Manchester United===
Later the same year, in a tribunal agreed [[pound sterling|£]]250,000 deal,<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/> he became [[Alex Ferguson]]'s first signing since taking over as manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Arsenal fans bemoaned the deal as manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] had no obvious replacement, spending most of the next season with the inexperienced (and midfield specialist) [[Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] in the No. 2 shirt, followed by the impossibly left-footed [[Nigel Winterburn]]. Anderson was finally replaced at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] when [[Lee Dixon]] arrived.

Meanwhile, Stevens had forced his way back in as England qualified for the European Championships and Anderson won his 30th and (what proved to be) final cap in a [[1988 Rous Cup|Rous Cup]] game against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] though was again in reserve when the squad went to Germany for the finals. They lost all three group games and Stevens came in for criticism, but maintained his place. For the third time, Anderson had travelled to a major international competition without getting a minute on the pitch. Robson began to look to the younger end of the playing spectrum for competition for Stevens, and Anderson's important international career ended.

Meanwhile, at [[Old Trafford]] Anderson was a significant part of [[Alex Ferguson]]'s rebuilding plans as he attempted to create a title winning side to end the wait that had started at the club in 1967. Following a dismal start to the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]] that had cost [[Ron Atkinson]] his job on 5 November, Ferguson had steered United from 21st to 11th of 22 First Division clubs in the final six months of the campaign. Anderson played his part in United's continued improvement in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]], as they finished second in the league but never really looked like overhauling [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], who finished champions by a nine-point margin with just two defeats all season as well as a 29-match unbeaten start to the 40-game campaign. Anderson remained first-choice right-back in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]], but United had a slow start to the season and despite an upturn in their form in the new year that saw them climb to third place by mid-February, a dismal final quarter of the season dragged them down to 11th place. Despite finishing 13th in the league in [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]], United won the [[FA Cup]] – but Anderson was not in the squad for the final. He had managed 21 games in all competitions that season but Alex Ferguson had chosen [[Paul Ince]] – normally a central midfielder – as his right-back for the first match (a 3–3 draw with Crystal Palace) and also the replay five days later, which ended in a 1–0 win.

Anderson's hopes of winning his place back in the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91 season]] were crushed when Ferguson paid [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] £625,000 for [[Denis Irwin]], who quickly established himself as the first choice right-back, while Ince switched back to central midfield. He played just three more games for the club, and on his final appearance for them in the Football League Cup second round second leg against [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] on 10 October 1990 he scored their first goal in a 2–1 win that gave a 5–2 aggregate victory.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Anderson joined [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on a free transfer in January 1991, helping them to promotion from the Second Division, although he missed the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final triumph over Manchester United as he had played for his old club earlier in the competition. Despite originally being thought of as a short-term signing, Anderson established himself in the Wednesday first team and captained the side on many occasions.<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/> He played an active part in ''the Owls'' team that finished third in the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and seventh in the [[1992–93 in English football|first season]] of the [[Premier League]]. He also helped Wednesday reach the [[FA Cup]] and League Cup final in 1993, but they were on the losing side to Arsenal in both finals.

===Barnsley===
Anderson's manner on the pitch made him an obvious choice for management and in June 1993 he left [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] to be appointed player-manager of [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] following the departure of [[Mel Machin]].<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/> However, his first season at [[Oakwell]] was a disappointment as Barnsley narrowly avoided relegation to Division Two.

===Middlesbrough===
At the end of [[1993–94 in English football|1993–94]], Anderson quit Barnsley after just a year to become assistant manager of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] under former [[Old Trafford]] team mate [[Bryan Robson]].<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/>

Despite retiring from playing football in 1994, Anderson was still officially registered as a player and following an injury crisis at Middlesbrough he played two games for the club in [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]] when they were promoted to Premier League as Division One champions. After gaining promotion he finally hung up his playing boots.

Anderson helped Robson assemble a side that reached both domestic cup finals (both of which they lost) in [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]], although they were relegated due to a three point deduction for postponing a December fixture at late notice as a result of so many players being unable to play due to illness or injury. However, Boro won promotion at the first attempt and were League Cup runners-up once again. Robson and Anderson finally left Middlesbrough in June 2001 when [[Terry Venables]] was brought in with the club facing relegation. Despite never achieving anything higher than ninth place in the final table the duo had managed to establish Boro in the [[Premier League]].

==After football==
Anderson has not been employed in football since leaving the assistant manager's job at Middlesbrough.

In 1997, Anderson was given the right-back slot by Forest fans voting for the club's all time greatest XI, gaining 96% of the vote.

He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in January 2000.<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/>

Anderson was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004 in recognition of his impact on the English league. He remains a keen supporter of the [[National Football Museum]] and regularly attends special events at the museum.

As of 2005, Anderson runs a sports travel agency and also works as a goodwill ambassador for [[the Football Association]].<ref name="Wednesday Boys"/> Anderson appears as an occasional guest pundit on MUTV – Manchester United's official TV station.

The [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]] has one of Viv Anderson's shirts on display in the Main Galleries. The shirt was worn on his debut match against Czechoslovakia in 1978.<ref>{{citation |title=Collection highlights, Viv Anderson's football shirt |publisher=People's History Museum |url=http://www.phm.org.uk/archive-study-centre/online-catalogue/}}</ref>

'''Anders Andersson''' (born March 15, 1974 in [[Tomelilla]]) is a former [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[soccer|football]] [[Midfielder|forward]] and TV pundit. He has played 27 international matches for the [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national team]], and was a squad player for the [[Euro 2000]] and [[Euro 2004]]. He also participated in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]].

He played for Svenstorps IF as a child, but joined [[Malmö FF]] in 1990. He gradually became a star in the [[Allsvenskan|Swedish league]], and was bought by English [[FA Premiership|Premier League]] outfit [[Blackburn Rovers]]. There, he played four league matches, and scored once against Preston North End in the League Cup.<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=Lancashire Evening Telegraph
|date=17 September 1997 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> He went on to play in Denmark and Portugal, and returned to Malmö FF in July 2005. He remained in the club until the end of the 2008 season, when the team decided not to extend Anders contract. The news was received with dismay among Malmö supporters, and Anders himself has written about the situation at his blog at local newspaper Skånska Dagbladet. [http://skd.se/article/20090102/SPORTBLOGG05/375481168/1164] He later decided to retire from football, ending speculation that he might've been heading to local rivals Trelleborg.

'''Andreas Claes Andersson''' (born 10 April 1974 in [[Nacka]], [[Sweden]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Association football|footballer]].  A [[striker]], he was [[cap (football)|capped]] by [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] forty-two times (including the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]), scoring eight goals.

Domestically, he won the 1996 [[Allsvenskan|Swedish league]] title with [[IFK Göteborg]], ending the seasons as the league's top scorer with nineteen goals. These performances earned him moves abroad to [[AC Milan]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (for whom he played in the [[1998 FA Cup Final]]).  These spells proved largely unsuccessful, resulting in Andersson's return to Sweden with [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]].

Injury problems caused him to retire on August 1, 2005, with Andersson looking to remain in football as a coach. However, he resumed playing in 2010 with Swedish minnows FC Andrea Doria.

'''Patrik "Bjärred" Jonas Andersson''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈpɑːtrɪk ˈanːdəˈʂɔn|pron}}; born 18 August 1971 in [[Borgeby]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] former [[Association football|footballer]]. Both his father, [[Roy Andersson (footballer)|Roy Andersson]], as well as his younger brother, [[Daniel Andersson (footballer born 1977)|Daniel Andersson]], have also played professional football.

==Club career==
Starting his career in the local club, Bjärreds IF, from which he also got [[Bjärred|his nickname]], he moved on to [[Malmö FF]], a team playing in the top national league. 

In December 1992, he went professional as he moved to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for £800,000, where he stayed for one year, making just 12 [[Premier League]] appearances. However, he is notable for being one of the first foreign signings by Blackburn Rovers, and one of the relatively small group of foreigners who appeared in the first season of the new [[Premier League]] in [[Football in England|England]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/342956.stm | title = Boom and bust the Blackburn way | publisher = BBC | date = 13 May 1999 | accessdate = 21 December 2010}}</ref>

There he won the [[1994–95 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] with the team in 1995, but left the team as its performance deteriorated, in 1999. The famous [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] became his next club. His time with Bayern resulted in two Bundesliga championships (in the [[2000–01 Bundesliga|2000–01]] championship season he scored the final and decisive goal against [[Hamburger SV]] in the last minute<ref>{{cite web | url =  http://www.sport1.de/de/fussball/fussball_bundesliga/artikel_104971.html | title = Vier Minuten im Mai | language = German | publisher = sport1.de | accessdate = 21 January 2010 | date = 12 May 2009}}</ref> – his only goal for the club) as well as a [[1999–2000 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] and victory in the [[2000–01 UEFA Champions League]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/anderssonpatrik/ | title = Patrik Andersson | language = German | publisher = fussballdaten.de | accessdate = 21 January 2010}}</ref> despite missing his penalty in the [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] shootout.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/1346307.stm | title = Bayern crowned European champions | publisher = BBC Sport | accessdate = 21 January 2010 | date = 23 May 2001}}</ref> Andersson moved to Catalan giants [[FC Barcelona]] in 2001 and spent three injury-plagued seasons there.

'''Darren Robert Anderton''' (born 3 March 1972) is an English former [[Association football|footballer]] who spent most of his career with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as a [[midfielder]]. He played 30 times for the [[England national football team]], scoring 7 goals.

==Career==
Anderton started his career in the Southampton Tyro League and played for Itchen Saints during a successful period for the side.  His potential was evident and he was soon scouted and playing youth football at professional clubs. Renowned as a player of huge potential, Anderton's career has been constantly frustrated by injury earning him the nickname "''Sicknote''"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1640891.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Anderton hands in his sicknote | date=6 November 2001 | accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref> which was coined by Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Andy Gosney]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-anderton-cheers-before-the-jeers-1157184.html |title=Football: Anderton cheers before the jeers |first=Andrew |last=Longmore |date=24 May 1998 |accessdate=2009-07-03 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London}}</ref>

===Portsmouth: 1990–1992===
Anderton was signed as an apprentice by [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] manager [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]], coming to prominence at 18 when he scored at [[Anfield]] in an [[FA Youth Cup]] match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] which ended 2–2. His first team debut came against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the second round of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in October 1990 as a substitute for youth team colleague [[Darryl Powell]]. Anderton made his full league debut against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in a 0–0 draw, making 20 appearances in the 1990–91 season. Under new manager [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]], Anderton became a regular in the attacking side of the 1991–92 season, scoring his first club goal in the season opener against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. His performances soon drew the attention of bigger clubs and after an impressive [[FA Cup]] run, during which he scored in a semi-final clash with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], he joined [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for £1.75 million in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/famousplayers/Darren-Anderton--overnight-superstar.1396519.jp|title=Darren Anderton – overnight superstar|publisher=Portsmouth News|date=26 March 2006|accessdate=2008-12-07}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur: 1992–2004===
After a slow start, Anderton settled at Tottenham, playing as a striker, forming part of an exciting attacking trio along with [[Teddy Sheringham]] and the young [[Nick Barmby]]. Two years later [[Terry Venables]] gave Anderton his [[England national football team|England]] debut against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in 1994. Anderton soon became a regular in the national side and turned down a move to [[Manchester United]] in the summer of 1995 following an exciting season spent playing with the likes of [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] at Tottenham, a decision that he later regretted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jiggins |first=Paul |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article2006425.ece |title=I regret snubbing Utd &#124; The Sun &#124;Sport&#124;Football |publisher=The Sun |date=5 December 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-06 |location=London}}</ref>

In October 2010, 15 years after this transfer saga, Anderton revealed that he had decided against a move to Manchester United because he had been happy at Tottenham and manager [[Gerry Francis]] was not happy at the prospect of losing another key player as he had already lost [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] and [[Gheorghe Popescu]] that summer; and [[Nick Barmby]] was on the verge of joining [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3172047/Darren-Anderton-reveals-he-could-have-taken-David-Beckhams-starting-spot-at-Manchester-United.html | location=London | work=The Sun | title=I couldve been ahead of Becks | date=8 October 2010}}</ref>

Despite missing most of the 1995–96 season through injury, Anderton played an important part in the [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]] England team that reached the semi-finals and included players like [[Paul Gascoigne]], [[Alan Shearer]], [[Steve McManaman]] and [[Teddy Sheringham]].  In the semi final against Germany, the match went to golden goal extra time. Anderton came within inches of putting England into the final when his shot hit the post.

Injuries then limited Anderton's international appearances considerably. He missed most of the 1997–98 season but was recalled for [[Glenn Hoddle]]'s squad for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France, starting on the right wing in the first two matches ahead of an out-of-sorts [[David Beckham]]. Hoddle later said in his World Cup Diary that he thought Anderton was equally as good as Beckham at crossing and was a better defender. Hoddle said he had waited 18 months to play Beckham and Anderton together on the right side of midfield. It finally happened as [[David Batty]] was dropped and the now-focused Beckham was recalled for the third game against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and played inside of Anderton. Anderton and Beckham were the England heroes as they both scored spectacular goals. In the second round against Argentina, England went on to lose on penalties. The following year Anderton won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] with Tottenham, and signed a new reported £24,000-week contract in March.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/688431.stm|title=Anderton signs new Spurs deal|publisher=BBC Sport|date=23 March 2000|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> After being sidelined during [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] with an [[Achilles tendon]] injury,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/743086.stm|title=Anderton out of Euro 2000|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 May 2000|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> an extended run of fitness saw Anderton vying for a permanent place in the national team again. He played in England's 1–1 draw away to [[France national football team|France]] in September 2000 and also featured against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] the following November.

In the summer of 2001 Anderton was heavily linked with a move to Liverpool but he remained at the club and his good form for Glenn Hoddle's Spurs during the early part of the 2001–02 season earned his first call-up to [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]]'s England squad for a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in November. Anderton was again selected by Eriksson for England's next game, a friendly against Holland, in February 2002. He would have started the game but was forced to withdraw through injury. One notable statistic about Anderton's England career is that his last five caps were given to him by five different managers. These were: vs Czech Republic (18 November 1998) by [[Glenn Hoddle]], vs France (10/02/99) by [[Howard Wilkinson]], vs France (02/09/00) by [[Kevin Keegan]], vs Italy (15 November 2000) by [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] and vs Sweden (10/11/01) by [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]].

Anderton continued to struggle badly with injuries for the rest of that season, missing out on a World Cup place. That summer the new [[Leeds United A.F.C|Leeds United]] boss [[Terry Venables]] tried to recruit Anderton, but he turned down the move out of loyalty to Tottenham. In the summer of 2003 Portsmouth and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]] made attempts to sign him, but Anderton opted against a move. He made a bright start to the 2003/04 season, scoring against Tottenham's bitter rivals Arsenal. However Hoddle was soon sacked and Spurs were in turmoil. Anderton remained at Tottenham until the summer of 2004. He was keen to remain at the club and was promised a new contract by [[David Pleat]] but the club, under the advice of incoming manager [[Jacques Santini]], reneged. In all, he appeared in 364 games for Spurs, scoring 51 goals. Santini went on to last a grand total of 13 games at the club. Anderton has been promised a testimonial but this is yet to materialise.

===Birmingham City and Wolverhampton Wanderers: 2004–2006===
[[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] swooped to sign Anderton on a free transfer for the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] season. His best moment for the Blues was scoring the winner in the 1–0 victory over Liverpool at [[Anfield]].

Anderton left Birmingham on a free transfer after one year and reunited with Glenn Hoddle at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], signing a one-year deal at the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/4170992.stm|title=Wolves complete Anderton transfer|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> He played 24 times for Wolves, scoring once in the league against Sheffield  Wednesday.<ref>{{cite news

===AFC Bournemouth: 2006–2008===
On 8 September 2006, Anderton joined [[Football League One|League One]] side [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] on a 'pay-as-you-play' basis, scoring a spectacular 40-yard free kick on his first team debut against [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportbox.tv/football/matchcentre/matchreport.php?id=3032512 |title=Bournemouth vs Scunthorpe - Football League One - Live MatchCentre |publisher=Sportbox.tv |date=23 September 2006 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> On 10 February 2007, he scored his first career hat-trick against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]]. Following a pre-season friendly with Portsmouth in July 2007, Portsmouth boss [[Harry Redknapp]] heaped praise on Anderton, telling the [[Bournemouth Daily Echo]]: "In the right team and with the right players around him, I honestly think he could still be playing in the Premiership".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thisisdorset.net/2007/8/1/127903.html |title=Cheeky One |publisher=Archive.thisisdorset.net |date=1 August 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref>

At the start of the 2007/08 season, Anderton was named as the new Cherries club captain by manager [[Kevin Bond (footballer)|Kevin Bond]]. Anderton spearheaded a survival bid at the end of the season, with the Cherries winning six of the seven last games, but, ultimately, a 1–1 draw with Carlisle on the final day saw Bournemouth relegated to [[Football League Two|League Two]]. Bournemouth were deducted 10 points earlier in the season for going into administration and had this not happened they would have finished in a respectable 15th.

Anderton signed a new one-year contract with Bournemouth at the start of the 2008/09 season which would have taken him past his 37th birthday. However, on 4 December 2008, Anderton announced he would retire on 7 December 2008, one day after his last game for club against [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7766130.stm|title=Anderton to retire from football|publisher=BBC Sport|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> In his last match, versus Chester, Anderton bowed out of football with a fairytale finish, as he scored the winning goal with a spectacular volley in the 88th minute after coming on as a substitute in the second half of the game.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/3956312.ANDERTON_S_FAIRYTALE_FINISH/ | title=Anderton's fairytale finish| year=2008 | publisher=[[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] | accessdate=2008-12-06}}</ref>

'''Leon Hougaard Andreasen''' (born 23 April 1983 in [[Aidt]], [[Jutland]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] professional [[Association football|football]] player, who plays as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] or [[midfielder]]. He has won twenty caps and scored three goals for the [[Denmark national football team]]. He currently plays for [[Hannover 96]].

==Biography==
Andreasen started playing football at local club Hammel GF. After a stay at the very popular football academy, Hessel Gods Fodboldkostskole in Grenaa, he moved on to the youth team of [[Aarhus Gymnastik Forening|AGF Aarhus]] in 1999, where he signed his first contract in 2001. He established himself as a regular in AGF's squad for the top-flight [[Danish Superliga]] championship. He initially played as a right midfielder or right back, but eventually settled in the [[central defender]] position. He was called up for the Danish under-19 national team in May 2001, and went on to play 31 games and score six goals for various Danish youth selections.

On 1 July 2005, he moved to Germany to play for [[SV Werder Bremen]] in [[Bundesliga]] championship. Due to the injury of [[Finland|Finnish]] defender [[Petri Pasanen]], Andreasen played 12 of the first 17 league games for Werder Bremen. When Pasanen recovered in December 2005, Andreasen was often relegated to the reserves' bench for the second half of the season. In May 2006, he was selected for the [[Denmark under-21 national football team|Danish under-21 national team]] squad for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2006 European Under-21 Championship]]. As age restrictions were calculated from the start of the qualification matches in September 2004, he competed in the tournament at age 23. When the Denmark under-21s were eliminated in the preliminary group stage, Andreasen's youth national team career was over.

In his second season at Werder Bremen, Andreasen only played four games in the first half of the season. In January 2007, he was [[Loan (football)|loaned out]] to German league rivals [[1. FSV Mainz 05]]. He made his debut on 27 January against [[VfL Bochum]], in the [[defensive midfielder]] position,<ref>{{cite web|title=VfL Bochum vs Mainz – Bundesliga 2006/2007|work=Football-Lineups.com
|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/match/3306/ | accessdate= 8 December 2013}}</ref> and went on to score four goals in his first seven games for Mainz. Although he couldn't prevent Mainz from being relegated, his stay at Mainz was a great success. In March 2007, he was called up to the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] by national manager [[Morten Olsen]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Lars Berendt | language = Danish | url = http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=237741 | title = 22 spillere mod Spanien | publisher = DBU | date = 14 March 2007 | accessdate = 21 January 2010}}</ref> He made his debut against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], where he replaced [[Martin Jørgensen]] in the first half, before he was substituted for [[Nicklas Bendtner]] in the second half.

He joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in January 2008 for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal that will see him at the club until the summer of 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2008/january/22/andreasen-joins-fulham | title = Andreasen Joins Fulham | date = 8 December 2013 | accessdate = 26 December 2010 | publisher = Fulham FC}}</ref>

Andreasen had limited chances to establish a place at Fulham and therefore left the club for Germany's Hannover 96 in the winter break in 2009. He initially signed on loan for 6 months and after strong performances, made a permanent move.

'''Martin Andresen''' (born 2 February 1977 in [[Kråkstad]]) is a former [[Norway|Norwegian]] football player. From 2008 to 2012, he was the manager of [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]].

==Club career==
Martin Andresen was a regular on many Norwegian national youth teams while playing for [[Moss FK|Moss]], [[Viking FK|Viking]] and [[Stabæk Fotball]] from 1995–1999. After the 1999 season, Andresen was sold to [[Premier League]] club [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in a deal worth £1. million. But like many of the other Norwegians in the club, his stay became short and unsuccessful. After a short loan spell at [[Molde FK|Molde]], Andresen returned to his motherclub Stabæk in 2001, where he proved himself to be one of the best central midfielders in Norway. When he were in Stabæk he also gave "kokkos" to Roar Strand which Roar Strand were not very excited for, this is one of Martin Andresen's proudest moments. 

After a brilliant 2003 season, where Stabæk captured the bronze medals in the [[Norwegian Premier League]], Andresen was loaned out to the [[Premier League|Premiership]] club [[Blackburn Rovers]] for six months in 2004, from February to August, but did not sign a longer deal with the English club. Andresen once again decided to return to Stabæk to save the club from relegation from the [[Norwegian Premier League]], but despite that Andresen played even while injured, Stabæk could not save their spot in the highest Norwegian league. Andresen, not willing to play in the [[Adeccoligaen|Adeccoliga]], asked to be sold. Many clubs in Norway were interested in the newly appointed national team [[Captain (association football)|captain]], but the high price scared many away, including the champions [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]]. Vålerenga looked set to capture Andresen just before Christmas 2004, but Brann, with help from local investors signed the midfielder on 23 December 2004.

===Brann===
Martin Andresen became the most expensive transfer in [[SK Brann|Brann]] history, in a deal worth ca. 15.000.000 NOK (£1.310.000). After a disappointing first season, much ruined by injuries, Andresen made it clear that he would be "fit for fight" in 2006. In the pre-season he was appointed captain for Brann, clearly showing his importance for the club on and off the field. In 2006, Brann had their best season opening ever,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} with Andresen filling the captain role. He also periodically captained the Norwegian national team, playing in central midfield. In 2007 Brann won the Norwegian League, with Andresen as captain. He was described as the most valuable player by many Norwegian pundits.{{who|date=May 2012}} He was also named in the Team of the Year.

===Vålerenga===
Andresen was announced as the new manager of [[Vålerenga Fotball|Vålerenga]] on 6 November 2007 while still under contract with Brann for the remainder of the year. Brann terminated their working relationship with Andresen the day after. He signed a three-year-long contract with Vålerenga as player and manager. Andresen became the first player/head coach in the Norwegian top division ([[Tippeligaen]]) since [[Kjetil Rekdal]] (also with Vålerenga) in 2002.

He retired as a player before the 2010 season, but continued to play several matches for the reserve team in the [[Norwegian Second Division]]. In 2011, he played for [[Follo FK]] who were in the same division, making eight appearances for the club.

On 15 October 2012, Andresen was dismissed as manager for Vålerenga.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2.no/sport/fotball/tippeligaen/martin-andresen-ferdig-i-vaalerenga-3900579.html|title=Andresen ferdig i Vålerenga|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

He came out of retirement and joined [[Stabæk Fotball|Stabæk]], who had been relegated from Tippeligaen, ahead of the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/sport/fotball/article3591601.ece |language=Norwegian |title=Martin Andresen gjør comeback |publisher=Nettavisen |first=Anders Modun |last=Bilet |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>

==International career==
He made his debut for [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in 15 August 2001 friendly match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and has earned a total of 43 caps, scoring 3 goals.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/noo-recintlp.html Norway – Record International Players] – RSSSF</ref>

==Private life==
Martin Andresen is an heir to the Norwegian furniture manufacturer [[Skeidar]].

He is also a keen [[contract Bridge|bridge]] player.<ref>{{no icon}} [http://bridgemagasiner.no/var/fckeditor/bridgemagasiner/file/Bulletiner/Norsk%20Bridgefestival/2003/bridgefestival_2003_stavanger_bulletin_3.pdf Norsk Bridgefestival 2003]</ref> In December 2009 he partnered Tor Helness to win one of the side events in the North American Bridge Championships in [[San Diego]].<ref>[[Daily Telegraph]] Bridge News p34 Issue no 48, 060 (dated 8 December 2009)</ref>

Andrews began his career as a trainee at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]], progressing from their academy to the first team. He made his senior debut on 18 March 2000 in a 2–1 win at [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]]. He continued his progress with the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club in the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]], becoming a regular player as [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]] took over midway through. He went on a loan spell at Oxford United, scoring once against Swansea City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/1016610.stm|title=Swansea 1–2 Oxford|publisher=BBC 
|date=11 November 2000 |accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> Back at Wolves, the final match of that season saw him become their youngest captain for more than a hundred years, at 21 years old, in a game against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].

He signed a new four-year deal the following season but found himself out of the starting line-up after several new midfielders were acquired in the summer, resigning him to the substitutes bench and sporadic appearances over the next few seasons. To gain playing time, he spent half of the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season on loan at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and the latter half at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], where he scored two league goals against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. He did however return to [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] in between to make his only [[Premier League]] appearance for Wolves (against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]).

The midfielder returned to Wolves' team post-relegation in [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] and gained his most appearances for the club during that season. However, he moved on at the end of his contract to join [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. In total, he made 72 appearances for the Midlanders, scoring once in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] tie at [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3585770.stm|title=Rochdale 2–4 Wolves|publisher=BBC |date=23 August 2004 |accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>

===Hull City===
His new start with the Hull saw him sidelined again though, as he picked up an injury in only his second appearance for the team – in a match against his previous team, Wolves. He returned to the team in December after nearly four months out and featured in all but one of their remaining fixtures in what proved to be his only season for the club.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
After a single year at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]], he moved to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] of [[Football League Two|League Two]] for the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] campaign where he became club captain. He lost out on promotion in the [[Football League Two play-offs#2007|play-offs]], despite scoring in the semi-final tie with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]].

However, the next year, now under the managerialship of his former [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] team-mate [[Paul Ince]], brought Andrews success. He scored the winning goal in a match at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] on 19 April 2008 that saw the club promoted to [[Football League One|League One]], and also scored the opening goal of their 2–0 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] with a penalty in the [[Football League Trophy]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7309420.stm | work=BBC News | title=Grimsby 0–2 MK Dons | date=30 March 2008 | accessdate=7 May 2010 | first=Mark | last=Mitchener}}</ref> The season ended with him being voted into [[PFA Team of the Year]] and having already won the League Two Player of the Year Award at the Football League Awards. Andrews was then named at number 38 in a ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' poll of the top 50 football league players, as well as being named the best player in League 2.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/footballleagueawards/archive/2008/03/02/fourfourtwo-50-best-football-league-players.aspx|title=FourFourTwo 50 Best Football League Players|publisher=FourFourTwo|date=2 March 2008|accessdate=2 March 2008}}</ref> [[MK Dons]] then had a fight on their hands to keep hold of their inspirational skipper with interest from a number of [[Premier League|Premiership]] and [[Championship]] clubs. He featured in MK Dons's first three games of the 2008–09 season but then was sold to [[Blackburn Rovers]] managed by former manager [[Paul Ince]].

===Blackburn Rovers===
Andrews ended a summer of speculation over his future when he completed a transfer to [[Premier League]] club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 3 September 2008 in a three-year deal worth and rising up to £1m depending on appearances made for the football club over the coming years.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/blackburn_rovers/7586080.stm | title = Blackburn snap up MK Dons skipper | publisher = BBC Sport | date=28 August 2008}}</ref> The move temporarily reunited him with his former [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]] manager [[Paul Ince]] before he was sacked as Rovers manager. He made his debut as a substitute on 6 September 2008 against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], a game in which Blackburn lost 4–1. Andrews made his home debut against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], on his 28th birthday, Arsenal went on to win the match 4–0. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in the 90th minute during a 2–2 draw with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]]. Due to injuries sustained by first team regulars, Andrews has featured frequently for the Rovers first team, occupying a defensive central midfield role. In July 2009, Andrews signed a new four-year deal, which will see him contracted to Blackburn until 2013. On 25 September 2010, Andrews came on for [[Steven Nzonzi]] on 66 minutes against [[Blackpool]] at [[Bloomfield Road]] in a 2–1 win for his first game of the 2010–11 campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292977&cc=5739|title=Emerton breaks Tangerine hearts|date=25 September 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet |accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>
The [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11]] season was a frustrating one for Andrews as he only made six appearances in all competitions for Rovers due to injury.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.clicklancashire.com/sport/blackburn-rovers-fc/129202-blackburn-rovers-midfielder-keith-andrews-set-to-miss-rest-of-season.html | title = Blackburn Rovers midfielder Keith Andrews set to miss rest of season | accessdate = 12 August 2011 | date = 24 March 2011}}</ref>

====Ipswich Town (loan)====
Andrews agreed to a six-month loan move to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on 12 August 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14493110.stm | title = Ipswich Town sign Keith Andrews from Blackburn Rovers| accessdate = 12 August 2011 | date = 12 August 2011 | work=BBC News}}</ref> This loan includes an option to buy the player permanently.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.greenun24.co.uk/ipswich-town/andrews_blackburn_blast_as_he_joins_town_on_loan_1_992117 | title = Andrews' Blackburn blast as he joins Town on loan | accessdate = 12 August 2011 | date = 12 August 2011}}</ref> A day later he made his debut in a 1–0 loss to [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and then 3 days later his first goal came against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. This was followed by goals against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Steve Kean, the head coach of Blackburn Rovers, hinted that Andrews' may return to his parent club in January 2012, after a successful loan spell with Ipswich. This was contrary to Andrews' ambitions, who when responding to reports that [[Paul Jewell]], the Ipswich head coach, wanted to sign him on a permanent deal, stated in an interview with the [[BBC]] that, "I don't particularly like the way I was treated at the club [Blackburn]. Not just the manager, the club in general."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ipswich Town quiet on move talks – Keith Andrews|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16290202.stm|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=21 December 2011|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>

===West Bromwich Albion===
Andrews completed a late deadline day (31 January 2012) free transfer to Albion, after handing in a transfer request at Blackburn. Andrews signed a six month contract. On 12 February, Andrews scored his first goal for West Brom and their fourth against former club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] in a 5–1 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wba.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~2595788,00.html |title=Andrews seals late Baggies switch |publisher=West Bromwich Albion  |date=29 April 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> Andrews then made it two goals in two appearances as he scored Albion's fourth in a 4–0 victory over Sunderland two weeks later. Andrews then made it three wins in three appearances as he produced another solid performance in the 1–0 win over Chelsea.

Andrews become a free agent as his West Brom contract ended at the end of the season.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Andrews signed for newly relegated [[Football League Championship]] club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 29 June 2012 after agreeing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwfc.co.uk/page/General/0,,1004~2827250,00.html?|title=Andrews Signs |publisher=Bolton Wanderers  |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref> He made his debut on 18 August in the away game at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and on 22 December he scored his first goals for Bolton scoring twice from the penalty spot in their 5–4 defeat against [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]]<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20738406</ref>

====Brighton & Hove Albion (loan)====
Following the permanent signing of [[Jay Spearing]], Andrews first-team place at Bolton was no longer assured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/wanderers/wanderersnews/10603410.Brighton_to_sign_out_of_favour_Wanderers_midfielder_Keith_Andrews/|title=Brighton to sign out of favour Wanderers midfielder Keith Andrews|publisher=Bolton News|date=9 August 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> On 9 August 2013, Andrews signed a season-long loan deal at fellow [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seagulls.co.uk/news/article/albion-seal-andrews-loan-982531.aspx|title=Albion seal Andrews loan|publisher=Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|date=10 August 2013|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> He scored his first goal for Brighton in a 1–1 draw with [[Sheffield Wednesday]] on 1 October 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24246250|title=Brighton 1–1 Sheff Wed|publisher=BBC |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>

==International career==
[[File:IrelandAlgeria2010.JPG|thumb|right|Keith Andrews (number 20) in a 2010 friendly for Ireland against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]]] 
Andrews made his full international debut for the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] on 19 November 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring a goal as part of a 3–2 home defeat in a friendly match against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=284&catid=1&Itemid=8|title=Ireland suffer defeat against clinical Poland side|publisher=FAI|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> He played his first competitive match for Ireland, being unlucky to have a goal disallowed in a 2–1 [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 8|World Cup qualification]] group match victory over [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Republic of Ireland 2–1 Georgia.

After being ever-present in Ireland's midfield during their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, he missed the start of their [[UEFA Euro 2012]] campaign due to an injury-hit [[2010-2011 Premier League|Premier League]] season. He returned to the Irish squad for the [[Nations Cup (football)|Nations Cup]] games against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He made an instant comeback to the Irish team with a good all round performance against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]].

On 7 June 2011, Andrews scored his second international goal in a 2–0 victory over four-time [[FIFA World Cup]] winners [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a friendly game in [[Liège|Liege]], Belgium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/13662923.stm|title=Italy 0–2 Republic of Ireland|date=7 June 2011|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> His third international goal came in the shape of Ireland's first goal, a header, in the 4–0 victory in the first leg of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] play-off against [[Estonia]] in [[Tallinn]], the second leg of which secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a 1–1 draw in Dublin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1111/estonia_ireland_report.html|last=Houston|first=Rory|title=Estonia 0–4 Republic of Ireland|date=11 November 2011|publisher=RTÉ Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2011/1115/ireland_quotes_players.html|title=Duff – Euro qualification an 'amazing feeling'|date=15 November 2011|publisher=RTÉ Sport}}</ref>

Andrews played every moment of Ireland's UEFA Euro 2012, until the very end of the final game when he was sent off against Italy. On 10 June 2012, in Ireland's first game of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group C|Group C]] against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], Andrews failed to score despite having a number of clear shots on goal and actually succeeding in hitting the woodwork; Ireland fell to Croatia by a score of 3–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2012/2012/0610/324424-republic-of-ireland-beaten-in-euro-opener/|title=Republic of Ireland 1–3 Croatia|date=10 June 2012|work=RTÉ Sport|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> Andrews's poor luck continued in the following game as Ireland crashed out of the tournament, falling to [[Spanish national football team|Spain]] by a score of 4–0 on 14 June 2012, before he was led off the field in a rage after receiving a red card in Ireland's final group game against Italy, a game the team lost 2–0. Thus Ireland finished the campaign bottom of [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group C|Group C]] with no points, having conceded nine goals and equalling the worst performance by a team in European Championships history.<ref>{{cite news|first=Daniel|last=McDonnell|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/euro-2012/irish-news/trap-sticks-to-tired-but-trusted-formula-3140723.html|title=Trap sticks to tired but trusted formula|date=18 June 2012|work=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' said he was "arguably Ireland's best performer in the tournament".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2012/0618/1224318193132.html|title=Irish nightmare completed in Poznan|date=18 June 2012|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 June 2012|quote=Andrews, arguably Ireland's best performer in the tournament, received a second yellow card a minute from time and summed up the frustration of the campaign by furiously kicking the ball away as he trudged off and stormed down the tunnel.}}</ref> Andrews was named as Irish Player of the Year for 2012<ref>http://www.lionofviennasuite.com/2013/2/4/3950930/keith-andrews-named-fai-player-of-the-year</ref>

'''Nicolas Sébastien Anelka''' ({{IPA-fr|ni.kɔ.la a.nɛl.ka}}; born 14 March 1979) is a French [[Association Football|footballer]] who is currently a [[free agent]]. He last played for [[Mumbai City FC]] in the [[Indian Super League]]. Prior to his retirement from international football, Anelka was also a regular member of [[France national football team|France national team]]. Former Chelsea manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] has described him as a quick player with good aerial ability, technique, shooting, and movement off the ball.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1842159 | title = Ancelotti: Anelka has it all | publisher = Chelsea FC | date = 31 October 2009}}</ref>

Anelka began his career at [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], but soon moved to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. He became a first team regular and won the [[PFA Young Player of the Year|PFA Young Player of the Year Award]] the following season. [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] signed him for £22.3&nbsp;million in 1999, but he did not settle in well and returned to Paris Saint-Germain in a £20&nbsp;million deal. Despite regular first team football in Paris, Anelka set his eyes upon the [[Premier League]] once more; he went on loan to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in January 2002 but joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] for £13&nbsp;million at the start of the 2002–03 season. After three seasons in Manchester, he moved to [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football team)|Fenerbahçe]] for two seasons before returning to England to join [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] – in deals worth £7&nbsp;million and £8&nbsp;million, respectively. He transferred to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] from Bolton for a reported £15&nbsp;million in January 2008. During his transfers over the years, he has built an aggregate transfer cost of just under [[pound sterling|£]]90&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficefootball.com/nicolas-anelka-second-most-expensive-player-ever/ |title=Nicolas Anelka second most expensive player ever |publisher=Box Office Football|date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> On 12 December 2011, [[Shanghai Shenhua F.C.|Shanghai Shenhua]] announced that they had reached an agreement with Anelka to join the team in the winter [[transfer window]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7357304/Anelka-deal-agreed |title=Anelka deal agreed |work=Sky Sports|date=7 December 2011}}</ref> After one season there, Anelka joined Italian side [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a six-month loan deal in 2013, after which he was released from Shanghai and signed for [[West Bromwich Albion]] on a free transfer.

Anelka has played 69 times at international level and won his first international honours with [[France national football team|France]] at [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], and won the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]] the following year. His failure to settle at club level limited his international appearances, but he returned to the national team for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] competition. On 19 June 2010, Anelka was excluded by the [[French Football Federation]] from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in South Africa for "comments directed against the national coach, [[Raymond Domenech]], unacceptable to the FFF, French football, and the principles they uphold."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/533826.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120915113032/http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/533826.shtml|archivedate=15 September 2012|title=Communiqué de la Fédération|publisher= [[French Football Federation|FFF]]|date=19 June 2010|accessdate=24 May 2014|language=French}}</ref> Two months later, having failed to turn up to his disciplinary hearing, he was banned for France's next eighteen games by the FFF, effectively ending his international career.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/france/7950246/Nicolas-Anelka-banned-for-18-games-by-France-after-World-Cup-disgrace.html | title = Nicolas Anelka banned for 18 games by France after World Cup disgrace |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 17 August 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burt}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Anelka was born in 1979 in [[Le Chesnay]], [[Yvelines]], to parents who had migrated from [[Martinique]] in 1974. Thereafter they settled in [[Trappes]], near Paris. His mother is a secretary in the local high school.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/sports/26iht-soccer.3674386.html "Nicolas Anelka haunts old coach as Bolton beats Arsenal"].

[[Le Point]]. 20 February 1999.</ref>

Anelka is married to [[Barbara Tausia]], a Belgian choreographer. Together, they have two sons, Kais born in 2008 and Kahil born in 2010.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/may/20/championsleague.chelsea3?2010. Chelsea: The players] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 May 2008; Retrieved 10 February 2009</ref> He acted in the 2002 film ''[[Le Boulet]]'' as a footballer named Nicolas. He has stated that, when he retires from football, he would like to work in the film industry because he has a friend in the business.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/oct/24/theknowledge.sport | work=The Guardian | title=Has a journalist ever won an international cap? | first=Tom | last=Bryant | date=24 October 2007| accessdate=20 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He said: "I have a friend who's a producer, who makes lots of films. He recently did ''Astérix''. So it's already agreed that I'm going to do other films. It helps to know actors and producers. It's different to football and it's something I enjoy very much because there's no ball. I like pretending to be somebody else, it's fun."

Anelka has two brothers, [[Claude Anelka|Claude]] and Didier.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/nov/30/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league The £85m man lights Blue touchpaper] ''The Observer'', 30 November 2008</ref>

After discussing religion with some childhood friends, Anelka converted to [[Islam]] in 2004 in the United Arab Emirates, taking the Muslim name of ''Abdul-Salam Bilal''.<ref>Taylor, Louise [http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/feb/14/newsstory.sport9 How Big Sam and Allah made Le Sulk smile] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 February 2007; Retrieved 10 February 2009</ref><ref>Moxley, Neil [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-484592/I-pray-times-day-boys-beardo--Ill-live-it.html I pray five times a day, the boys call me beardo...I'll live with it] ''Daily Mail'', 28 October 2007; Retrieved 10 February 2009</ref> Anelka has said that he initially fasted during daylight hours as is required for the Muslim month of [[Ramadan]], but "I realised I often got injured just after the period of Ramadan, so I don't observe it strictly any more."<ref name="independent">{{cite news |last=Din|first=Tusdiq|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/fasting-and-football-how-do-topflight-muslims-cope-2342187.html|title=Fasting and football. How do top-flight Muslims cope?|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=23 August 2011|accessdate=1 January 2013|location=London}}</ref> Initially, Anelka considered leaving European football to play in the UAE: "I am ready to stay here and to play for a club in the Emirates. I am not keen to go back to England or France." However, this did not come to pass and he briefly moved to Turkey instead, as well as three more English clubs.<ref>Stammers, Steve [http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/muslim-anelka-to-quit-england-7231953.html Muslim Anelka to quit England]. ''[[London Evening Standard#Websites|This is London]]'', 10 June 2004; Retrieved 24 May 2014</ref>

Anelka is also known for his controversial relationship with French comedian [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]] and notably attracted widespread condemnation after performing a hand gesture called the "[[Quenelle (gesture)|quenelle]]", created by the latter and regarded by some as anti-Semitic, on the pitch when playing for West Bromwich Albion in 2013.<ref name='BBC report on Anelka "quenelle" gesture'>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Anelka: West Brom striker defends goal celebration|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25537686|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> Anelka has responded that the gesture is anti-establishment, not anti-Semitic.<ref name='BBC report on Anelka "quenelle" gesture'/> An FA disciplinary hearing banned Anelka for five games, but found that he was not anti-Semitic, and had not intended the gesture to express or promote anti-Semitism.<ref name='Nicolas Anelka banned and fined £80,000 for "quenelle" gesture'>{{cite news|title=Nicolas Anelka banned and fined £80,000 for 'quenelle' gesture|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26326484|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=27 February 2014}}</ref> After West Bromwich Albion suspended him pending their own investigation, Anelka was given notice of termination of his contract by the club due to the club and player being unable to come to terms over the conditions required for the suspension by the club to be lifted, and comments made by the player on [[Twitter]].<ref name='Albion update on Anelka Contract Status'>{{cite news|title=Albion update on Anelka Contract|url=http://www.wba.co.uk/news/article/albion-update-on-anelka-contract-march-2014-1421762.aspx|accessdate=15 March 2014|newspaper=[[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]]|date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

Anelka was Arsenal's top scorer in the [[1998–99 Arsenal F.C. season|1998–99 season]] with 17  [[1998–99 FA Premier League|Premier League]] goals. This form saw him voted the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]], but Arsenal failed to defend their Premier League and FA Cup titles and made little progress in the [[1998–99 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. Fans turned on the striker amid transfer speculation and a perceived lack of enthusiasm, giving him the nickname ''"Le Sulk."''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_4547209,00.html|title=Anelka – I'm no 'Le Sulk'|date=25 November 2008|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|accessdate=29 November 2008}}</ref> During the close season, Anelka stated a desire to leave Arsenal, claiming the British press was responsible for his unhappiness in England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/405221.stm|title=Anelka: The story so far ... |date=2 August 1999|accessdate=29 June 2013|work=BBC}}</ref> On August 2, 1999, Anelka joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/408603.stm|title=Suker replaces Anelka at Arsenal|date=2 August 1999|accessdate=29 June 2013|work=BBC}}</ref>

In the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]], Anelka delivered Chelsea's seventh penalty, which was  saved by [[Edwin van der Sar]], resulting in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] winning the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Anelka later blamed manager [[Avram Grant]] for his penalty miss, claiming Grant brought him on to play as a late substitute without a proper warm up beforehand and also too late in the game to acclimatize himself in it.

On 3 August 2008, Anelka scored four goals in a 5–0 friendly win against [[A.C. Milan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Chelsea rout sorry Milan|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/1196/report|accessdate=22 March 2014|newspaper=[[Sky Sports]]|date=3 August 2008}}</ref>

With [[Didier Drogba]] injured at the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Anelka made a very impressive start to the campaign. He scored 25 times – 19 of which in the Premier League, making the Frenchman the first player to reach 10 goals in the competition that season.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} For this, he was awarded with a [[English football champions#Premier League (1992–present)|Golden Boot]] Award on 14 November 2008 and was in the running for the end of season Golden Boot accolade.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://origin-www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1454924,00.html| title=Anelka win Barclays Golden Boot Award|publisher=Premier League|date=14 November 2008}}</ref> Anelka scored his first competitive hat-trick for Chelsea against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], in a 5–0 home win on 1 November 2008, and followed this up with two braces against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], then [[West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Bevan |first=Chris |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/7684736.stm |title=Chelsea 5–0 Sunderland |work=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> He established himself as an important member of the squad and maintained his place in the team despite the return to fitness of Drogba.

Anelka started the 2010–11 campaign in fine form for Chelsea. He assisted [[Florent Malouda]]'s last goal against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on the opening day of the season, scored a double in the next game against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], and won a penalty against Stoke City in Chelsea's third game of the season. He continued this fine form in Chelsea's first Champions League game, scoring a first half brace against [[MŠK Žilina]]. Further goals against Marseille and Spartak Moscow ensured that this was the first season since playing for [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] that he had scored at least four goals in a UEFA Champions League Season.

==International career==
[[File:NAnelka.jpg|thumb|upright|Anelka playing for France]]
At youth level, Anelka played for the French under-20 team at the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997 World Youth Championship]], and made his senior team debut for [[France national football team|France]] in a goal-less draw with [[Sweden national football team|Sweden national team]] on 22 April 1998. Anelka was not selected for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] winning squad but quickly became France's first choice centre forward during the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifying campaign]], scoring the opening goal in France's 3–2 win over [[Russia national football team|Russia national team]] on his first international start<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.11v11.com/api/match/265847/teamID/2076/view/extended | title = France v Andorra | publisher = 11v11 | date = 14 October 1998}}</ref> and scoring both goals in a comfortable 2–0 win over [[England national football team|England national team]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in February 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.itv.com/sport/football/news/generalnews/nicolas-anelka-factfile-163972364.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100624051022/http://www.itv.com/sport/football/news/generalnews/nicolas-anelka-factfile-163972364.html |archivedate = 24 June 2010 | title = Nicolas Anelka factfile | publisher = ITV Sport | date = 20 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2010/article-1281335/Enigmatic-Nicolas-Anelka-make-World-Cup-debut-winning-France.html | title = Enigmatic Nicolas Anelka out to make his World Cup debut a winning one with France | publisher =Daily Mail | date = 26 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Anelka made his first appearance in a major tournament at [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]]; France went on to win the competition. He also formed part of the squad which won the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]].

'''Juan Pablo Ángel Arango''' (born 24 October 1975) is a retired Colombian [[Association football|footballer]] who last played for [[Atlético Nacional]] in [[Categoría Primera A]].

He began his career at Nacional, whom he helped to win the championship in 1994, and then moved to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] of Argentina, where he was the league's top scorer in 2000. The following year he moved to Europe, joining [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] of the [[Premier League]] for a club record £9.5 million. In 2007, he moved to the United States, where he played for three clubs in [[Major League Soccer]] before returning to Atlético Nacional in 2013.

Ángel was also a full international for [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], and made 33 appearances from his debut in 1995, scoring 9 goals.

==Career==

===Atlético Nacional and River Plate===
Ángel started playing professional football at [[Atlético Nacional]] in his home city of [[Medellín]]. Ángel began to make a name for himself when he scored the winning goal against local rival [[Independiente Medellín]] to help Nacional capture the 1994 Colombian title.<ref>http://members.fortunecity.es/cucutaverde/HistoriaVerdolaga.htm</ref> During his time with his hometown club Ángel would appear in 147 league matches scoring 45 goals.

Ángel was sold to [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] in Argentina in January 1998 as a replacement of the departed [[Hernán Crespo]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://stats.globesports.com/epl/players.asp?player=5431| title=Player Biography|publisher = globeandmail.com}}</ref> River Plate spectators would often adorn angel wings to show their appreciation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/04182007/sports/red_bulls_finally_land_their_man_sports_brian_lewis.htm
|title=Red Bulls Finally Land Their Man|author=Lewis, Brian|date=18 April 2007|publisher=[[The New York Post]]}}</ref> During his time with the club, Ángel managed 62 goals in 132 games, including 16 goals in 25 [[Copa Libertadores]] matches.

===Aston Villa===
Ángel signed for [[Premier League|English Premier League]] side [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 12 January 2001, becoming the club's [[List of Aston Villa F.C. records and statistics#Record transfer fees paid|record]] signing at [[Pound sterling|£]]9.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/1105856.stm |title=Villa to complete Angel deal |date=12 January 2001 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> In his time at Villa, he was reportedly Villa's highest earner. After an indifferent start to his Aston Villa career, and family difficulties, Ángel settled down and started to reproduce the form that had persuaded chairman [[Doug Ellis]] to spend the large transfer fee. He quickly became a fans favourite and is the 2nd most recent Villa player to have scored more than 20 goals in one season (behind [[Christian Benteke]] in the 2012-13 season), finishing as the club's top scorer in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003-04]] season with 16 goals in the [[FA Premier League]],<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/topscorers?league=ENG.1&year=2003&&cc=5901] JPA ninth highest scorer in EPL</ref> (23 goals including cup competitions) but could not maintain that form as Villa struggled and he only managed seven goals in [[Aston Villa F.C. season 2004–05|2004-05]]. During his time with the club, Ángel managed 62 goals in 205 games across all competitions. Only two players have scored more goals for Villa in the [[Premier League]] era, those being [[Dwight Yorke]] (97 goals in 288 games) and [[Gabby Agbonlahor]] (74 goals in 284 games).

===New York Red Bulls===
On 17 April 2007, the [[New York Red Bulls]] announced the signing of Ángel as their second designated player, pending the approval of his work visa. After his [[Visa (document)|visa]] was approved, Ángel made his Red Bull debut 8 May 2007 in a [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|US Open Cup]] [[2007 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualifying]] match. Ángel came on as a substitute and scored from a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] in [[After extra time|extra time]] during the Red Bulls' 3-1 loss to [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].  
 
Ángel also recorded an assist and played an important role in a third goal to round off a performance that earned him that week's MLS Player of the Week award.<ref>{{cite news| publisher = [[Major League Soccer|MLS]]| title = New York Red Bulls forward Juan Pablo Angel wins MLS Player of the Week honors for Week 7| url = http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070521&content_id=94666&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp| date = 21 May 2007}}</ref> His form showed no signs of letting up in the following game, as he weighed in with two goals and another assist as the Red Bulls overcame [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] to win 3-0, taking them to joint top of the Eastern Conference.

Ángel was voted [[MLS Player of the Month]] for May 2007.<ref>{{cite news| publisher = [[Major League Soccer|MLS]]| title = New York Red Bulls' forward Juan Paublo Angel voted MLS Player of the Month for May| url = http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070531&content_id=96124&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp| date = 31 May 2007}}</ref> He became the first Red Bull to score in six straight games.

On 18 August 2007, Ángel added two more goals to his tally. His team defeated Los Angeles Galaxy 5-4. Ángel scored the first goal early on from a free kick before striking a late winner to seal the game for the Red Bulls.  Ángel also scored the first goal of the [[2007 MLS All-Star Game]] on 19 July 2007 against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], and later was named [[Man of the match|MVP of the Match]] for his performance.<ref>[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20070720&content_id=106956&vkey=pr_rbn&fext=.jsp&team=t107] press release via RBNY site</ref> On 29 September 2007, Ángel scored a penalty to tie the Red Bulls' game against [[Real Salt Lake]] and in doing so scored his 17th goal of the season in all competitions, setting a new franchise record. Ángel concluded his initial campaign in New York scoring 19 goals and 5 assists in 24 league matches (20 goals in 27 matches in all official competitions). His regular season goal total was one short of [[Luciano Emilio]] who led the league with 20 but who had also played more games.

Ángel had a slow start to the 2008 season due to an arthritic nerve-related injury in his lower back that caused him to have pain in his hamstring but he finally scored his first of the season in his fourth appearance - a 2-1 winner against LA Galaxy on 10 May. On 5 June he fought through a still painful injury to score the only goal in New York's home win against [[Chivas USA]]. However, in doing so he also picked up another slight hamstring strain and after the final whistle he was seen limping off the pitch. As a result of this injury Ángel missed the Red Bulls' next 4 league games. Even through this injury-plagued season, his three goals were enough for coach [[Steve Nicol]] to name him to the [[2008 MLS All-Star Game]] vs [[West Ham United]] in which he fed the pass that earned the game winning penalty kick and also scored a goal that was disallowed due to a controversial offside. Ángel concluded his second season in New York scoring 14 goals in 23 league matches (16 goals in 28 matches in official competitions).

Ángel's third season in New York was a major disappointment as the club had one of the worst seasons in club history. The club was quickly eliminated from play-off contention and failed to qualify to the group stages of the [[CONCACAF Champions League]]. However, Ángel still had his moments during the campaign as he became the clubs all-time leading goal scorer. On 26 September 2009 he scored the equalising goal in a 1-1 draw at [[Chivas USA]], that goal being the 46th of his career with New York and breaking [[Clint Mathis]] former record of 45. Ángel ended his season leading the club in scoring for the third straight year scoring 12 goals in 25 league matches.

Juan Pablo Ángel's [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010 season]] was greatly improved. He started off slow but slowly progressed during the first half of the season to claim a total of 11 goals from 19 games. He slumped in the second half of the season but concluded the season as the club's top scorer with 13 goals in 30 regular season appearances.  On 2 June 2010, Angel scored the game-winning goal in a match against the Houston Dynamo, snapping a four game losing streak. On 21 October 2010 Ángel assisted [[Dane Richards]] on the opening goal in a 2-0 victory over [[New England Revolution]] which helped New York clinch its second ever regular season [[2010 Major League Soccer|Eastern Conference]] title.<ref>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/red-bulls-beat-revs-clinch-eastern-conference ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>

On 11 November 2010 it was announced that he would not be returning to the Red Bulls for the 2011 Major League Soccer season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kristian Dyer |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/backe-red-bulls-may-stick-two-dps |title=Backe: Red Bulls may stick with two DPs |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> Ángel holds the club record for goals scored in all competitions with 62.<ref>[http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/story-159827.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref>

====Play-offs====
On 26 October 2007, Ángel told the New York Daily News, "It's very American, in every sport the playoff system ... I think there should be more credit to the guys who do well in the regular season. It's interesting. It's a little bit unfair. I'm trying to understand it. I might answer you in a different way in a couple of weeks."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2007/10/26/2007-10-26_red_bulls_star_juan_pablo_angel_learning-2.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Red Bulls star Juan Pablo Angel learning about A-Rod rule | date=26 October 2007}}</ref> A week later, Ángel and the Red Bulls were knocked out of contention for the [[2007 MLS Cup]] by the [[New England Revolution]] on a 1-0 aggregate score as Ángel pleaded to his manager to be brought back on after coming off for treatment to a head injury received during the match which turned out to be a concussion.

The following season Ángel would help lead the Red Bulls to their first ever [[MLS Cup 2008|MLS Cup final]]. On the way they defeated [[Houston Dynamo]] 3-0 (4-1 Aggregate) and [[Real Salt Lake]] 1-0, but ultimately lost the final to [[Columbus Crew]] 3-1. After a poor 2009 season the Red Bulls failed to qualify for the post season for the first time since Ángel's arrival.

The New York Red Bulls qualified the next season for the playoffs, with Ángel doing extremely well during the regular season. They ended up losing in the first round of the playoffs, losing 3-2 on aggregate, where Ángel scored a late goal to make the intense game 2-1 (2-2 aggregate) but Chris Wondolowski scored an even later goal to win it. This game was [[Juan Agudelo]]'s break-out game in the MLS.

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
After the [[2010 MLS season]] New York declined Ángel's contract option and Ángel elected to participate in the [[2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft]]. On 15 December 2010 Ángel was selected by [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft.<ref>[http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/wolff-angel-selected-re-entry-stage-2-draft ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> On 19 January 2011 the club announced that they had signed Ángel to a multi-year contract which would make him the Galaxy's third designated player.<ref>{{cite web|author=LA Galaxy Communications |url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2011/01/la-galaxy-sign-forward-juan-pablo-angel |title=sign forward Juan Pablo Angel |publisher=LA Galaxy |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> He scored his first goal of his 2011 Galaxy campaign in a 4-1 loss against [[Real Salt Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2011/3/26/2074498/la-galaxy-real-satl-lake-juan-pablo-angel |title=LA Galaxy Striker Juan Pablo Angel Scores The Most Juan Pablo Angel Goal Of All Time, Puts LA Galaxy On The Board |publisher=SBNation.com |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>

===Chivas USA===
On 17 August 2011, Ángel was traded to [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] to make room for new Los Angeles [[Designated Player Rule|designated player]] [[Robbie Keane]].<ref>{{cite web|author=LA Galaxy Communications |url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2011/08/la-galaxy-trade-juan-pablo-angel-chivas-usa |title=trade Juan Pablo Angel to Chivas USA |publisher=LA Galaxy |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> Ángel scored his first goal for 'the Goats' in his debut against the [[Colorado Rapids]]. Returning to form, he would go on to finish the 2011 season with 7 goals in just 9 games.

Ángel remained with Chivas USA through the 2012 season. His contract expired after 2012 and he made himself eligible for the [[2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft]] in December 2012. Ángel became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds.

===Atlético Nacional===
Ángel's career did a full circle in January 2013 when he signed a one-year contract to play for his first club, [[Atlético Nacional]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.univision.com/sudamerica/colombia/article/2013-01-23/angel-regresa-al-atletico-nacional#axzz2Iqf1GkwF |title=Fútbol Colombiano &#124; Calendario, Resultados, Posiciones &#124; Univision Fútbol |publisher=Futbol.univision.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref> He arrived as a reinforcement to try to solve the goal drought in the tenure of coach [[Juan Carlos Osorio]]. As a sign of the commitment to the team, his wage is 30 million [[Colombian peso|pesos]] (US$15,600) per month compared to his former salary in the US was 300 million pesos (US$156,000) a month.

On 2 February 2013 Ángel wore green again as a starter at the [[Estadio Atanasio Girardot]]  where he scored a goal in his team's 3-0 victory against [[Atlético Huila]] for the Apertura 2013 league.

He played in the second leg of the final Sudamericana Cup on 10 December 2014, which was his final game.

'''Marcos Alberto Angeleri''' (born 7 April 1983) is an Argentine [[association football|footballer]] who plays for Spanish club [[Málaga CF]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]].

==Career==

===Estudiantes===

Born in [[La Plata]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], Angeleri made his first appearance for Estudiantes in 2002. He played in the championship decider for the [[2006-2007 in Argentine football|Apertura 2006]] title, and in 2008 was called by [[Diego Maradona]] to the [[Argentina national football team]].

Angeleri is mostly deployed as a [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wingback]] on the right, where he is noted for his aggressive defense and solid transition play along the right flank. Under coach [[Diego Simeone]] he also played as a [[Defender (association football)#Sweeper (libero)|libero]]. His freedom to join the attack was increased after the arrival of [[Leonardo Astrada]] as coach in mid-2008, causing Angeleri to be noticed by Maradona and by South American sports journalists, who voted Angeleri in a top-ten place in the 2008 edition of the [[South American Footballer of the Year]] award.<ref>[http://www.elmundodeportivo.es/web/gen/20090102/noticia_53608923543.html El Mundo]</ref>

In 2008 Angeleri was part of the Estudiantes team that finished as runners up in the [[Copa Sudamericana]] [[Copa Sudamericana 2008|2008]], and then was a regular player in the team that won the [[Copa Libertadores]] [[Copa Libertadores 2009|2009]], although he missed the latter stages of the tournament through an injury, which also frustrated a transfer to Europe, where several top sides were interested in him. Having fully recovered, Angeleri played in the 2010 Clausura tournament and the 2010 Copa Libertadores.

Angeleri's nicknames have been a matter of some good-natured controversy. Former Estudiantes coach [[Carlos Bilardo]], who is noted for his [[superstition]]s, argued that "Mambrú" was a poor choice<ref>[http://frasespinchas.blogspot.com/2008/05/carlos-salvador-bilardo.html Frases Pinchas]</ref> ("Mambrú" is the subject of a [[Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre|children's song]] that relates how the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] died fighting a war).<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/notacompleta.php?id=746&sc=1&vote=1 El Gráfico]</ref> "Comandante" was proposed (referring to [[Subcomandante Marcos]]), as well as "Cacique" (chief). Angeleri revealed that his childhood nickname was "Cascarita" (egg shell); other nicknames bestowed upon him are "Gordo" (fat guy) and "Cobra" (for his aggressive defending).

===Sunderland===

Angeleri signed for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Premier League]] for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of £1.5 million on a three-year contract on 24 July 2010,<ref>{{Cite news |title=Sunderland sign Argentine defender Marcos Angeleri |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/8852163.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 July 2010 |accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref> after training with Sunderland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Full-back Marcos Angeleri trains with Sunderland|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/8800638.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> Weeks later, reports claimed that Angeleri was unsettled in England, a report denied by [[Steve Bruce]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruce dismisses Angeleri reports|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/bruce-dismisses-angeleri-reports-1-1503555|publisher=Sunderland Echo|date=9 August 2010|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> Eventually, He was included in Sunderland's 25-man squad for the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bruce names squad |url=http://www.safc.com/news/20100901/bruce-names-squad_2256213_2142076 |publisher=Sunderland AFC |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> In late November, reports claims Angeleri was linked with a move to a French Giant [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Fanni linked to Marseille|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/6540115/|publisher=Sky Sports|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> He made his debut on 26 December 2010 against [[Manchester United]] as a late replacement for [[Bolo Zenden]] in a 2–0 defeat. He made his first start for Sunderland in a FA Cup match against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] on 8 January 2011. With few appearance, his time in England was forgettable, having failed to make an impact and even worse his first team opportunities were limited. In March, Angeleri was selected for the [[Argentina National Football Team|Argentina national squad]] despite having played only three matches during the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stunning cap call for Marcos Angeleri|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/sunderland-afc/safc-news/stunning_cap_call_for_marcos_angeleri_1_3182627|publisher=Sunderland Echo|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> Shortly after, Angeleri was in a row with Bruce after accusing Bruce of avoiding him and told ESPN Radio ''"The boss doesn't talk to me, he doesn't even say hello to me when he sees me, I think he doesn't like me because I'm not English. Steve Bruce is not a nice person at all. He is a little unpleasant. I have played just a few minutes in Sunderland since my arrival. I want to play, that's my job. That's why I'm not happy here in Sunderland. I don't understand why I'm not playing.
