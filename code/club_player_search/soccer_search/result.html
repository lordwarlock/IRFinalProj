                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Everton move fifth with 3-0 victory over Newcastle at St James' Park
Goals from Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku and Leon Osman saw Everton move fifth in the Premier League as they beat Newcastle 3-0 at St James' Park on Tuesday evening.
Barkley produced a stunning solo run from inside his own half before powering into Newcastle territory and firing into the roof of Tim Krul's net.
Osman picked out Gerard Deulofeu on the right wing shortly after the restart and the Barcelona loanee slid an inch-perfect square ball for Lukaku to crash home.
The visitors added a third shortly before time as Deulofeu and Lukaku linked up to find Everton captain Osman, who struck into the top right-hand corner with power and precision.
It was the hosts who made the brighter start on Tyneside as Luuk de Jong and Yoan Gouffran both had an opportunity to break the deadlock inside two minutes.
Dutch forward De Jong's off-balance shot from the edge of the box was denied by the outstretched knee of John Stones, before Gouffran - who was unchallenged in the area - entirely missed the ball following a return ball from Moussa Sissoko.
Everton's riposte came in the form of a change of pace from Spanish attacker Deulofeu, who skirted down the right flank, beating two defenders, but was unable to find Lukaku in the centre.
Roberto Martinez's side could have taken the lead after 15 minutes, Osman's first-touch pass from Deulofeu's squared ball released Lukaku in the box.
The Belgian striker's initial touch took the ball away from Fabricio Coloccini, but his low shot was well saved by a sprawling Krul in the Newcastle goal.
Everton eventually took the lead midway through the first period as England midfielder Barkley produced a magnificent solo display.
The 20-year-old gathered possession 70 yards out before powering past a host of Newcastle defenders, drifting from right to left as he advanced into the box, where he fired ferociously into the roof of Krul's net.
Newcastle were sharp in response as Vurnon Anita and Papiss Cisse exchanged passes on the edge of the area, before the latter was crowded out by Stones and Seamus Coleman.
Despite holding the advantage, Everton spent a prolonged period supressed in their own half and Cheick Tiote - fresh from striking the woodwork on Saturday - shaped a stinging 25-yard effort toward goal, before a bravely interjection from the head of Sylvain Distin.
Everton's superior pace shone after the break as they doubled their advantage within seven minutes of the restart.
Osman's precision cross-field ball picked out Deulofeu on the right wing and his first touch took him away from Paul Dummett before offering an inch-perfect square ball for Lukaku to thump home his fourth goal in as many matches from three yards out.
Gouffran sought to keep Newcastle in contention as he attempted an audacious first-time volley from Tiote's cross on the edge of the box, only for his effort to soar over the crossbar.
The introduction of Hatem Ben Arfa brought a much-needed injection of creativity and the France international soon jinked between three Everton defenders before squaring to Anita, who was unable to convert from five yards, squandering the hosts' best chance of the second half.
The wrapped up victory with a third goal shortly before full time Deulofeu and Lukaku linked up to find Everton skipper Osman in space on the edge of the box and struck into the top right-hand corner of Krul's net with venom.
A first away win of the calendar year sees Everton elevated to fifth in the Premier League standings, one point ahead of Tottenham, who they still have a game in hand on.

                        <li><span>report: Two goals from Romelu Lukaku gave West Brom a 2-1 victory over Sunderland
A penalty and a fluke from the impressive Romelu Lukaku earned West Brom a 2-1 win over Sunderland at the Hawthorns.
A Craig Gardner handball and poor Titus Bramble clearance were responsible for the Belgian's two goals, and Sunderland could not find an undeserved equaliser after a deflected Stephane Sessegnon gave the away side hope.
The headline team news came on the West Brom bench, with the selection of Peter Odemwingie in the matchday squad causing something of a stir with the home crowd following the Nigerian's much-publicised deadline day escapades. For Sunderland, January signing Danny Graham was selected alongside Steven Fletcher for the first time in an attacking-looking line-up.
The game started quietly as both sides looked to settle on the ball without threatening to open the scoring. In fact, the first half-chance of the game did not arrive until the 20-minute mark when Lukaku drifted a header wide from ten yards out.
It was a moment that kick-started the half into gear, and moments later Sunderland had three chances in succession to score. First Fletcher side-footed the ball against the left-hand post, and from the rebound Graham forced Ben Foster into a smart save. The ball then fell back to Fletcher, who fired over from the edge of the box.
Five minutes later Youssouf Mulumbu should have given the home side the lead, inexplicably missing from four yards out with a header when it looked easier to score, and two minutes later referee Roger East was involved in controversy when he failed to give West Brom the advantage when James Morrison had been fouled, and Lukaku tucked the ball passed Simon Mignolet.
However, three minutes later the Baggies were ahead. Chris Brunt crossed from the left and the ball hit Gardner on the hand, allowing Lukaku to nonchalantly finish from the penalty spot.
The goal gave the home side confidence, and they ended the half impressively as they looked to make the most of their dominance as the half-time whistle came as a relief to Sunderland, although the visitors did have their own penalty appeal for handball turned down.
West Brom continued to be dominant during the second half, and it became something of the Lukaku show. He scored his second on 70 minutes when a short backpass from Bramble allowed the forward to bear down on goal. Mignolet came rushing out, but his clearance rebounded off Lukaku and into the net.
The Belgian was comfortably the best player on show, and the contrast between the standing ovation Lukaku received when he came off for Odemwingie, who was roundly booed, was marked.
Two minutes later and Sunderland were back in the game, when Sessegnon curled home a shot from the edge of the area, beating Foster via an Olsson deflection.
Despite late chances, notably for James McLean who fired over in added time, West Brom were able to hold on for a home victory that took them to seventh in the Premier League.

                        <li><span>report: Loan star Lukaku sinks Royals
Romelu Lukaku marked his first start for West Brom with a goal to see off a resilient Reading side.
The Belgian was dangerous all game using his pace to the Baggies' full advantage and finally his tenacity paid off when second-half substitutes Graham Dorrans and Shane Long combined to release the forward who shifted the ball on to his left and drilled it past an impressive Alex McCarthy.
The hosts had the better of the chances with Jonas Olsson striking the post with a first-half header and James Morrison forcing a top drawer save out of McCarthy with a powerful effort.
Reading's efforts were few and far between with Pavel Pogrebnyak and Adam Le Fondre often struggling for service and Jobi McAnuff becoming increasingly frustrated with referee Chris Foy for waving away two penalty decisions.
Garath McCleary could have had the goal of the season if his overhead kick was a shade either side of Ben Foster who ended up collecting the audacious effort comfortably.
It was quite an eyebrow-raiser when West Brom chief Steve Clarke left out Long against his former club in favour of Lukaku - on loan from Chelsea - however, the gamble appears to have paid off as the Baggies finished off a trio of wins in their opening three home fixtures in the top flight for the first time in 58 years.
Albion were the more threatening for long periods against Brian McDermott's side despite not firing on all cylinders.
Morrison impressed in midfield and put in a man of the match performance, as Lukaku posed problems with his pace and power before delivering the killer touch.
It leaves Reading still searching for their first win since returning to the Premier League and West Brom keeper Foster was untroubled throughout the 90 minutes.
Albion started brightly and Reading defender Chris Gunter had to react quickly to cut-out a Lukaku flick-on intended to pick out skipper Chris Brunt.
Lukaku skipped past the challenge of Kaspars Gorkss and drilled a dangerous low ball across the box but Danny Guthrie was alert to the situation before a Baggies player could connect.
Brunt produced the first serious attempt on goal with Royals 'keeper McCarthy turning his low 25-yard drive around the post at full stretch.
Reading threatened when McCleary attempted an overhead kick which contained plenty of power but flew straight into the arms of Foster.
Lukaku continued to pose a threat in his lone man position up top and McCarthy finger-tipped away a floated cross at full stretch steered towards Brunt at the far post.
Albion looked the more likely to score and Morrison found space in the box after exchanging passes with Zoltan Gera but he scuffed his right-footed shot across the face of goal.
Morrison seemed in two minds whether to shoot or pass when he got in behind the Reading defence and his eventual chip was too high for Lukaku, which summed up a disappointing opening half.
The nearest either side came to scoring in that period came at the end of the first-half when Albion defender Olsson saw his header hit the woodwork from a Brunt corner.
Albion continued on the offensive after the break with Gera having a shot charged down.
Baggies defender Liam Ridgewell vented his anger at Pavel Pogrebnyak after feeling the striker had gone down too easily under a challenge in what seemed a rather frustrating afternoon for both sides in the stop-start encounter.
McCarthy had to be alert to push aside a fierce dipping volley from Morrison as West Brom looked the more likely to break the deadlock.
Former Albion defender Nicky Shorey floated a trademark left-footed free-kick wide in his first start since rejoining Reading during the summer.
West Brom fans chanted Long's name before he was introduced after 65 minutes - and six minutes later he had played his part in the winner against a side he spent six seasons with.
Another substitute in the shape of Dorrans floated a ball into the box which was knocked by back by Long to Lukaku who steadied himself before driving a low shot past the dive of McCarthy.
Reading tried to respond and substitute Hal Robson-Kanu peeled off at the far post and got on the end of a McCleary cross.
But his header landed on the roof of the net and the home side comfortably saw out time in the closing stages.

                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Romelu Lukaku scores twice as Everton beat Newcastle 3-2 to go fourth
Romelu Lukaku's first-half brace on his home debut helped Everton go fourth in the Premier League with a 3-2 victory over Newcastle at Goodison Park.
The Belgium international's performance was one, but not the only, reason why his new team displaced parent club Chelsea in the Champions League places as Everton made it six matches unbeaten - a league start not matched for seven years.
Lukaku's fledgling partnership with Ross Barkley, playing behind in the hole, also resulted in Everton's other goal as the 19-year-old collected a lay-off from the Belgian to score his side's second after charging through the middle of an obliging Magpies defence.
Substitute Yohan Cabaye, a surprise omission from the starting line-up, made Newcastle's only real impact with a brilliant 30-yard strike just after the interval.
But even conceding their first goal in 11 hours 27 minutes could not knock Everton out of their stride and Loic Remy's 89th minute goal gave the scoreline a lop-sided look.
Everton's pace and passing was fast and crisp and Kevin Mirallas often, and right-back Seamus Coleman slightly less frequently, tore the left side of the visiting team to shreds.
It was also not as if Newcastle had not had due warning about the threat of Lukaku. Ever since he arrived on deadline day he was talked about as being the Toffees' game-changer.
Within two minutes he had opened up the visitors' defence but his cheeky backheel into the net was the clue he already knew the flag had gone up.
Three minutes later there was no reprieve as Mirallas left Davide Santon trailing in his wake to cross low for Lukaku to stroke home despite Tim Krul's best efforts to keep out the shot.
Lukaku and Barkley had a practice run for the second goal when the big striker laid the ball off for the attacking midfielder to fire first-time wide of the far post.
They perfected the move midway through the half when Sylvain Distin and Mirallas picked out Lukaku who fed Barkley through the middle and he charged past Fabricio Coloccini to clip past Krul for the academy graduate's first Goodison goal.
Everton's third goal was pure route one as goalkeeper Tim Howard's punt downfield was seized upon by Lukaku, easily beating a statuesque Coloccini and rounding Krul before gleefully firing into the open net from close range.
Lukaku found the net again but was denied by another offside flag before Newcastle finally registered their first shot, Howard easily saving low from Hatem Ben Arfa.
The Frenchman and Mapou Yanga-Mbiway were replaced at half-time by Cabaye and Mike Williamson respectively.
Newcastle, who have won one of their last 11 league trips to Goodison Park and have taken just 16 points from their last 23 away games, pulled one back within six minutes thanks to Cabaye's blistering long-range strike.
But there was to be no inspiring comeback like the 4-4 draw against Arsenal from an even worse position in 2011 and, even though Remy poked home from close range late on, it was little consolation.

                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Romelu Lukaku stars as West Brom win 3-0 at Southampton 
Romelu Lukaku scored one and set up two in West Brom's fiery 3-0 victory at Southampton, in a game which saw three men given their marching orders.
The visitors took a thoroughly deserved lead through Marc-Antoine Fortune, who bundled the ball over Artur Boruc, after Lukaku had flicked a corner back into the six-yard box.
An excellently taken strike from the giant Belgian doubled the Baggies' lead, before Saints' substitute Gaston Ramirez and the visitors' Fortune were both sent off by referee Robert Madley, making his Premier League debut.
Shane Long netted his first goal in nine games shortly afterwards to seal the points for the visitors, but there was still time for Danny Fox to be dismissed in what turned out to be an unforgettable Premier League introduction for rookie referee Madley.
The Baggies were much the better side right from the word go with Lukaku, who came close in the opening five minutes, having two more efforts well saved by Boruc.
The on-loan Chelsea star had a big hand in the opening goal, keeping a corner alive by winning a header which Fortune did well to stab goalwards under pressure, and the ball just crawled over the line in time before it was cleared.
With his side in the ascendancy, Lukaku's chance at the end of the opening period was the best of the lot when, after an intricate team move, the young Belgian found Boruc a formidable opponent again as he saved well low to his right.
Nathaniel Clyne, who had the hosts' only effort on goal in the first half, almost netted a surprise equaliser early in the second period, digging a shot out of nowhere which evaded Ben Foster in the Baggies' goal, but came back off the crossbar.
The meagre resistance that the Saints were offering was soon halted by the killer second goal from the Baggies. Fortune held the ball up well, turned and played a perfect through pass for Lukaku to latch onto, and the 19-year-old made no mistake this time, rounding Boruc and slotting the ball into the empty net.
The home side seemed to lose all composure, which was evident as Ramirez received a red card for a needless swing of the arm at Liam Ridgewell, and Fortune joined him after unnecessarily raising his hands in the fracas that ensued.
The result was put beyond doubt when Long raced through and placed his finish underneath a helpless Boruc after more good work from Lukaku to provide the assist.
Despite desperately needing a response, the Saints' ill-discipline continued, as Fox saw red for a dangerous two-footed lunge of Steven Reid.
After going six games unbeaten, the scoreline did come somewhat out of the blue, but the impressive Baggies have now accumulated their highest points total in the Premier League, and the Saints will not suffer too much, as they are practically safe with three games to go.
West Brom boss Steve Clarke was impressed with the improvement in his side.
"It was important that we got the first goal," he said.
"We talked about it beforehand and made sure that we started well.
"It was almost the perfect away performance."
Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino was critical of his side's woeful display.
"From my point of view we just didn't start in the game," Pochettino told Sky Sports.
"We didn't feel comfortable, especially when we conceded the first goal in the sixth minute.
"Then we became a bit fearful of their attacking strikers, who were quite fast, strong and physically fit."

                        <li><span>report: Papiss Cisse's injury-time winner helps Newcastle beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1
Papiss Cisse's lucky injury-time winner secured a 2-1 victory for Newcastle against unlucky West Bromwich Albion.
It was a desperate way to finish for the visitors who after being outplayed in the first half, were dominant for large periods after the break and were close to securing the spoils before the late drama.
After Romelu Lukaku cancelled out Demba Ba's opener, the Baggies looked the only team likely to strike again, only for substitute Cisse to deflect home a shot with his back and bag only Newcastle's second win in eight league games.
Considering how bright West Brom were in the second half, it was a surprisingly lacklustre and error-ridden start by Steve Clarke's outfit who came to St James' Park hunting a victory that would have hoisted them to fourth.
But being able to recall big-hitters keeper Tim Krul, Ba and captain Fabricio Coloccini after being rested for Thursday's Europa League venture, it was the Magpies who looked initially hungry and sprightly.
Ba, Shola Ameobi and Hatem Ben Arfa were causing havoc in the opening exchanges and the hosts could easily have been three goals to the good within 20 minutes.
First Ba nodded Ameobi's cross shockingly high and wide from five yards, Ameobi then headed straight to Ben Foster and the keeper was again on red alert, pushing away Davide Santon's low shot.
Finally, the Baggies spurted into life and on-loan striker Lukaku was through on goal from Graham Dorrans' through ball, only for Krul to stand strong and palm to safety.
It was all-out attack for both teams in a breathless final 15 minutes of the half and it was the Newcastle faithful who were celebrating, yet again from Ba's clinical shooting boots.
A long punt by Krul was flicked on by Ameobi and after centre-back Gareth McAuley's poor header, Ba pounced to thump the ball home for his seventh goal in nine league matches.
With just two away league goals this season, the joint-lowest in the Premier League, West Brom had the perfect chance to boost their tally before the break, but again the hesitant Lukaku could not beat Krul when clean through.
The urgency and menace gathered momentum in the second half for the visitors and they deservedly drew level (55), with Lukaku making amends for his profligacy, nodding in Zoltan Gera's teasing cross at the back post.
Sloppy in possession and dragged around by their revitalised opponents, Newcastle threw on Gabriel Obertan and Cisse, but West Brom were sniffing the win and substitute Shane Long twice went close.

                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Crystal Palace beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park
Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Everton 3-2 at Goodison Park and pick up their first win of the Premier League campaign.
The hosts dominated the early exchanges and deservedly went ahead in the ninth minute via Romelu Lukaku from Leon Osman's pass.
But Palace gradually came into the game and equalised through Mile Jedinak on the half-hour mark after Tim Howard had brought down James McArthur in the box.
Yannick Bolasie hit the woodwork shortly before the break before Howard then mis-judged a cross from Martin Kelly to allow Frazier Campbell to head Palace's second from close range on 54 minutes.
Bolasie slotted home Jason Puncheons pass on 69 minutes to further extend the visitors' lead but Leighton Baines reduced the arrears on 83 minutes from the penalty spot after Scott Dann brought down Osman to set up a grandstand finish.
However, Julian Speroni pulled off a string of saves as the Eagles held on for a vital win, whilethe final whistle brought a juddering halt to the hosts' recent revival and left them stuck on five points from as many Premier League games.
Bolasie's heroics sealed another fine day for Palace in the blue half of Merseyside after a 3-2 win in April eased relegation fears under old boss Tony Pulis.
Now managed by Neil Warnock, the Eagles were under the cosh early on from Everton, who had handed afull debut to veteran striker Samuel Eto'o.
The Cameroonian had the first shot on target in the sixth minute, then Christian Atsu shot into the side netting before Lukaku opened the scoring in the ninth minute.
Osman's neat lay-off on the edge of the box sent the Belgian barging through and he finished with aplomb low to the right of helpless Palace keeper Speroni.
Lukaku should have had a second four minutes later when he was served up a fine chance in front of goal by Eto'o following a Baines' corner from the right, but the striker completely mis-kicked.
Palace barely surfaced in the first half hour but moments after Osman had shot straight at Speroni they seized their chance to draw level when Howard fouled McArthur in the box and referee Michael Oliver pointed to the spot.
Jedinak stepped up to fire the ball confidently past Howard and give Warnock's men a sudden foot-hold in the game that had earlier threatened to pass them by.
The goal swung the momentum in Palace's direction and they almost seized the lead five minutes before the break when Bolasie's deflected effort struck Howard's crossbar.
Palace kept pushing at the start of the second half and they went ahead on 54 minutes when Howard flapped terribly at Kelly's cross from the right allowing Campbell to get just enough power on the ball to flop it over the line.
Lukaku and Gareth Barry missed chances to draw level but it got worse for the hosts in the 69th minute when Puncheon nicked the ball off Osman and played a perfect low ball to the unmarked Bolasie to stroke home.
Substitute Steven Naismith missed a chance to immediately reduce the deficit as he failed to get the vital touch to a Kevin Mirallas cross, then Dann made a vital interception to deny Lukaku and an Osman effort through a crowd of players was saved by the unsighted Speroni.
Baines set up a frantic finale when he swept home a penalty seven minutes from time after Dann had brought down McCarthy in the box.
Jagielka dribbled an effort inches wide and Lukaku scythed an 88th-minute effort across the face of goal as Palace waded through six minutes of injury time to secure the points.

                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Everton make it five wins in six away at Aston Villa
Romelu Lukaku netted his fifth goal in Everton colours as the Toffees clambered into third spot in the Premier League table with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa.
The second-half introduction of Leon Osman swung the game in the Toffees' favour, with the England man assisting the opener and grabbing the second himself in front of the watching Roy Hodgson.
Villa will feel that they should have been out of sight by the time the deadlock was broken, with Tim Howard producing a string of impressive saves in the opening 45 minutes.
The best of the lot came with just eight minutes on the clock, with the American goalkeeper springing to his right to touch a Christian Benteke penalty over the top after Seamus Coleman had tripped the powerful Belgian striker inside the box.
The hosts keep pushing after the interval, but fell behind on 68 minutes when Osman teed up Lukaku to drill first time into the bottom corner past a hopelessly exposed Brad Guzan.
Osman then doubled Everton's lead nine minutes from time, with a well-worked corner routine allowing him to be picked out on the edge of the box by Gareth Barry and stroke into the back of the net.
Everton took just 30 seconds to create their first opportunity, Kevin Mirallas whipping a cross towards Lukaku who fired wide under pressure from Ron Vlaar.
At the other end Benteke gave the ball away with his first two touches only to earn a golden chance to mark his return from the spot.
A chip into the area from Andreas Weimann had given Benteke a run on goal and he was only stopped when Coleman clipped his heels in pursuit.
Benteke's spot-kick was powerful enough but Howard guessed right and then thrust a glove up for a sensational save.
Villa then conspired to miss two glorious chances in the space of as many minutes.
Benteke was on the end of the first, played in this time by Aleksandar Tonev's clever touch in the 23rd minute. He waited for the ball to drop and again found Howard's reactions too good as he shot across goal from 10 yards. Yet Leandro Bacuna, arriving at the far post, was begging for the pass.
Weimann spurned an even better chance moments later, a mysteriously absent offside flag giving him space and time to run at Howard. But he somehow got the ball caught under feet and the keeper made a sliding tackle.
If Villa could have been three up, Everton were soon making gilt-edged chances of their own.
Guzan matched Howard's effort with a fine save from Lukaku after he got a strong header on Coleman's cross and Ross Barkley was inches away from the opener when a deflected effort from 25 yards looped over the keeper and on to the crossbar.
The breakneck speed slowed somewhat but a 0-0 scoreline at the break hardly seemed believable.
A most unlikely stalemate seemed to be in the offing until Lukaku struck.
Leighton Baines broke down the left wing before playing the ball infield for Osman. He spotted Lukaku arriving in the area and the striker swept home Osman's pass with a clinical left-footed effort.
His celebrations had barely subsided when he was appealing for a penalty against Vlaar. The Dutchman's hand did make contact with the ball but there was no obvious intent.
With 15 minutes left, the quiet Gabriel Agbonlahor shot straight at Howard from a wonderful position eight yards out.
Villa's hopes died in the 81st minute when Barry held the ball up deep in the penalty area before cutting back for Osman.
He addressed the ball cleanly and slotted a low shot inside Guzan's post to secure the points.

                        <li><span>report: Premier League: Lukaku and Osman goals help Everton to 2-1 win over West Ham
Leon Osman's second goal of the season sealed a 2-1 victory for Everton over high-flying West Ham at Goodison Park.
Romelu Lukaku opened the scoring for Everton in the first half with Osman's 73rd-minute strike sandwiching a West Ham reply by Mauro Zarate.
The win takes Everton up to 17 points in the Premier League, one behind West Ham, who started the day in fourth place.
In the 26th minute, Ross Barkley cleverly controlled a headed pass from Naismith to wrongfoot a defender but, as he shaped to strike the ball, it was blocked.
The wild deflection fell kindly to Lukaku, in space on the left of the six-yard box, and the Belgium international calmly gave West Hams Spanish keeper Adrian little chance as he swept it in for the opening goal.
Eleven minutes later Lukaku put the ball in the back of the net for a second time but was ruled off-side.
In the second half, Argentine striker Zarate, who had only just come on for West Ham as a substitute, picked the ball up on the right in the 56th minute, ran across the top of the Everton box and fired through several defenders.
The ball hit Jagielkas out-stretched leg and took a big deflection over the advancing Tim Howard, who could do nothing to prevent the ball looping high over his head and into the net for the equaliser.
James McCarthy went close for Everton three minutes later after running at James Tomkins, cutting inside and curling a beautiful shot just past the far corner of the goal.
 Close 
The decisive goal came in the 73rd minute after Lukaku broke quickly over the half-way line and James Collins took him out.
Ref Mark Clattenburg played an excellent advantage and Samuel Etoo, on as a substitute for Kevin Mirallas, collected the ball to thread a perfect ball across the box to Osman racing in on the far side. And midfielder Osman made no mistake to put Everton back in front with his second goal of the season.
Moments later Howard kept Everton in front with a point-blank save with his legs from Collins.
In the dying minutes Osman and Eto'o again combined with a wonderful one-two on the edge of the West Ham box, Osman pulling it back in front of the goal only for the Cameroon international to hit it hard - but wide.
I was quite impressed with West Ham. With the amount of injuries they had, they did alright.You take five players out for a team like West Ham and send them to Everton and you think theyd get done, but they were really good.
Lukaku might have been offside for Everton's first goal, the equaliser. I think he got lucky. But thenWest Ham were very good, moved the ball quickly and put crosses in and put Everton under pressure. Then, against the run of play, Everton went down the other end of the park and Osman scored.

                        <li><span>report: Dimitar Berbatov inspired Fulham to a 2-1 win at West Brom in the Premier League
Fulham enjoyed the perfect start to 2013 after recording a first Premier League victory at The Hawthorns as Alex Kacaniklic's goal secured a 2-1 win over West Bromwich Albion.
The impressive Dimitar Berbatov had given Fulham a first-half lead, but the muscular presence of Romelu Lukaku drew the hosts level early in the second period.
However, Kacaniklic rolled home the decisive goal just before the hour mark to hand Fulham only a second win in 13 games to lift Martin Jol's side away from the relegation places.
A New Year hangover seemed to be affecting both teams for much of the first half, with a lack of fluency to the game and neither goalkeeper troubled.
Gareth McAuley and Gabriel Tamas headed set-pieces wide for West Brom, while at the opposite end Berbatov and Giorgos Karagounis both fired over from outside the penalty area.
A rare moment of class produced Fulham's opener six minutes before half-time as Berbatov sent Ashkan Dejagah scampering down the right before the Bulgarian ambled into the box to sweep home his team-mate's return pass.
After a lacklustre first half, West Brom were a different team in the second period and were level within four minutes when Lukaku was left alone inside the six-yard box to turn home Billy Jones' low pass following clever work by the full-back.
Lukaku, who has impressed during his loan spell from Chelsea, almost gave West Brom the lead three minutes later when his thumping volley came back off the upright.
The Belgium international was in the thick of things again on 55 minutes as his shot was kept out by David Stockdale before James Morrison struck the rebound against the post and Chris Brunt saw his goalbound effort diverted clear by Aaron Hughes.
Yet the Baggies were floored by a sucker-punch on 58 minutes as the recalled Kacaniklic superbly controlled Bryan Ruiz's pass on the edge of the box before slotting a low shot past the stranded Ben Foster.
Steve Clarke's side took time to recover from that setback and turned to Peter Odemwingie and Shane Long for inspiration, with the latter's cross 15 minutes from time headed wide by Lukaku.
Fulham were still a threat on the counter and could have had a penalty with 10 minutes to go when Ruiz was caught by Youssouf Mulumbu, but it mattered little as only a late Jones cross threatened to deny Jol a win against the club he represented during his playing career.
