                    <li><span>Summary: Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Holloway, London that plays in English football's top tier, the Premier League. One of the most decorated clubs in English football, they have won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and a joint record 11 FA Cups. Arsenal have one of the best records in top flight matches, having accumulated the second most wins, the second most points, the ongoing record longest uninterrupted period in the top flight, and would be placed first in an aggregated league of the entire 20th century. At 14 and 49 matches, Arsenal hold both the longest winning streak and the longest unbeaten streak; the latter includes the only completely unbeaten season since Preston North End's 16 match shorter equivalent in the inaugural Football League season 115 years before. Arsenal was founded in 1886 in Woolwich and in 1893 became the first club from the south of England to join the Football League. In 1913, they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In the 1930s, they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the League and FA Cup Double, in the 197071 season, and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles and reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Since neighbouring Tottenham Hotspur, the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the North London derby. Arsenal have one of the highest incomes and largest fanbases in the world, including the second most lucrative stadium and the third most Twitter followers. Forbes estimates the club is the fifth most valuable association football club in the world, valued over 1.3 billion in 2014.<br>
