He signed for them as an apprentice on leaving school in July 1990 and turned professional for the 1992-93 in English football1992\u201393 season, when they were FA Premier League founder members. He made his debut against Norwich City F.C.Norwich City on 5 December 1992 when they lost 2\u20131 in the league at Carrow Road. A further three appearances followed that season, but he had far more chances in the 1993-94 in English football1993\u201394 campaign with 23 appearances and his first senior goal, as the Dons finished sixth\u2014equalling their highest-ever league finish. The next two seasons brought limited first-team opportunities, but he had more chances of action in 1996-97 in English football1996\u201397, when he scored twice in 18 league games as the Dons finished eighth in the Premier League and were semi-finalists in both domestic cups. For much of the season, the Dons were in the top five of the Premier League and they were rarely more than a few points off the top of the table, so the failure to achieve UEFA Cup qualification was quite a disappointment, though the season was still a great success for a club of Wimbledon's stature.\nFear featured in a famous weekly comedy sketch in Match magazine''Match'' magazine, entitled \"What if Peter Fear was?\" the picture would then show the player in a humorous new job such as a vicar, or, most famously, as a potato.\nPeter Fear's career highlight to date was scoring twice in the space of ten minutes, against Tottenham Hotspur in the 1997-98 in English football1997\u201398 season. Unfortunately for Fear, Wimbledon went on to lose the game 6\u20132, and Fear's goals counted merely as a consolation. They were the last goals he would score for the Dons, as he was back on the sidelines and managed just eight league games that season. He made the team just twice in 1998-99 in English football1998\u201399, before signing for Oxford United on a free transfer on 13 July 1999.\nOxford had just narrowly avoided bankruptcy when Fear joined them, and had been relegated to Division Two. He played 38 league games over two seasons, scoring three goals, helping them narrowly avoid a second successive relegation in 1999-2000 in English football1999\u20132000 but not being able to prevent relegation in 2000-01 in English football2000\u201301, when Oxford suffered 33 league defeats (the joint second worst ever of any Football League or Premier League club) and went down in bottom place. Fear then left the club.\nOn the edition broadcast on 23 August 2007, Peter was a contestant on the TV gameshow The Weakest Link.

He switched permanently to A.C. PratoPrato in 1995, and made 30 league appearances for the club, before moving again to S.S. LazioLazio in 1996.

He signed permanently for the English club in 2000, and quickly dislodged Ed de Goey from the number one spot, being voted Chelsea's Player of the Year for the FA Premier League 2001-022001\u201302 season, and the ITV (TV network)ITV  Premiership Goalkeeper of the Season for the FA Premier League 2002-032002\u20132003 season. However, he struggled with injury for the following season, and Petr Cech was signed in 2004; Cech would displace Cudicini as the number one goalkeeper, with Cudicini only appearing sporadically afterwards. In 2006, both Cech and Cudicini suffered head injuries in a game against Reading F.C.Reading; as Cudicini recovered sooner, and third-choice goalkeeper Henrique Hil\u00e1rio's form dipped, he briefly took over the starting role, until Cech returned towards the end of January 2007. Cudicini left Chelsea in 2009, having made 141 league appearances for the club, and joined local rivals Tottenham Hotspur F.C.Tottenham Hotspur. At Tottenham, he remained second-choice or third-choice throughout his spell, and only made 19 league appearances for the club; first Heurelho Gomes, then Brad Friedel and Hugo Lloris kept him out of the team.

He is a regular pundit on BT Sport football coverage and sometimes appears on BBC's ''Match of the Day'' as a pundit. Since retiring from football he has become a successful racehorse breeder and owner.\nThe son of former footballer Terry Owen, Owen was born in Chester and began his senior career at Liverpool F.C.Liverpool in 1996. He progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his debut in May 1997. In his first full season in the Premier League he finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool's top goal scorer from 1997\u20132004 and gained his name as a proven goal scorer, despite a recurring hamstring injury. In 2000\u201301 Liverpool F.C. season2001, Liverpool won a cup Treble (association football)treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and Football League Cup, and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d'Or 2001Ballon d'Or. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool, and 158 goals in 297 total appearances. Regarded as one of the greatest Liverpool players, Owen came 14th in the \"100 Players Who Shook The Kop\" \u2013 an official Liverpool fan poll.[\nOwen moved to Real Madrid C.F.Real Madrid for \u00a38&nbsp;million in mid-2004; he was frequently used as a substitute (football)substitute. He scored 13 goals in La Liga before returning to England the following season where he joined Newcastle United F.C.Newcastle United for \u00a316&nbsp;million. After a promising start to the 2005\u201306 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return he became team Captain (association football)captain and was the team's top scorer for the 2007\u201308 Newcastle United F.C. season2007\u201308 season.

His performance at the 1998 FIFA World Cup brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to score in UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004. He is the only player to have scored in four major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from.

Harper is best remembered for playing in the Football League First DivisionChampionship winning Everton side of the mid-1980s.\nHarper was a utility player whose first-choice position was right-back but he could perform competently in almost any position on the park and he frequently turned up in central defence, at left-back, centre midfield, wide midfield and sometimes even as a makeshift striker. Perhaps partially as a result of his great versatility however, he often found himself used as a squad player rather than as a first-team regular at many of the clubs he played for. He is remembered as a largely unspectacular but solid and reliable performer who very rarely made a mistake. Harper scored few goals but many of those he did score were spectacular efforts, often from long range. Everton fans nicknamed him 'Bertie Bassett' because he played in 'allsorts of positions'.\nHarper started out at Liverpool F.C. in the late 1970s, the club he had supported as a boy, but he never made a first team appearance for Liverpool before Howard Kendall took him across Stanley Park, LiverpoolStanley Park to Everton in the summer of 1983 for \u00a3100,000. Harper initially became first choice right-back but after a few months he lost his place to Gary M. StevensGary Stevens, who went on to become an England national football teamEngland international. From then on, Harper never really held down a regular first team place at Goodison ParkGoodison but like Kevin Richardson (footballer)Kevin Richardson, he became a vital squad player, filling in for various positions on the park when first-teamers were injured and frequently appearing as a substitute. During his first season, Harper scored a spectacular goal against his previous club Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Goodison. Everton went on that season to finish runners-up to Liverpool in the Football League CupLeague Cup before winning the FA Cup at Wembley Stadium (1923)Wembley in May, beating Graham Taylor (footballer)Graham Taylor's Watford F.C.Watford 2-0. Harper was an unused substitute at Wembley and he received a cup winners medal as a result.\nThe following season, 1984/85, Everton won the League Championship and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as well as finishing runners-up in the FA Cup to Manchester United F.C.Manchester United. This was the most successful season in Everton's history and Harper played an important role as a squad player - he received both a Championship winners medal and Cup Winners' Cup medal (again he was an unused substitute in the final). Everton were not allowed to contest the following season's UEFA Champions League due to the ban on English clubs entering European competition after the Heysel Stadium disaster involving Liverpool F.C.\nThe following year Everton were runners-up to rivals Liverpool in both the League Championship and the FA Cup - Harper came on as a substitute in the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday F.C.Sheffield Wednesday and scored Everton's opening goal with an audacious lob from outside the area. Then in 1986/87, Everton reclaimed the league title and Harper received his second Championship medal after playing in the majority of Everton's games due to an injury crisis in the first half of the season. Harper scored a vital and spectacular winner at Chelsea F.C.Chelsea during the title run-in.\nHoward Kendall then left Everton to join Athletic Bilbao and a year later in 1988 Harper left Everton for Sheffield Wednesday in search of regular first-team football. Wednesday paid \u00a3275,000 for Harper's services but after a fairly unremarkable spell at Hillsborough StadiumHillsborough, he rejoined Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City F.C.Manchester City in December 1989 for a fee of \u00a3150,000 and he became City's regular right-back. Kendall returned to Everton the following autumn and in the summer of 1991 he took Harper back to Goodison for \u00a3200,000. After two more seasons with the Toffees, Harper left top-flight football to play for Luton Town F.C.Luton Town in 1993 and a year later he joined Burnley F.C.Burnley. After two seasons at Turf Moor, Harper retired from professional football.\nAfter retirement, Harper went back to Everton once more in the early 2000s as a youth coach, spending several years there before leaving in 2005.\nIn November 2007 he was employed as a scout by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers F.C.Bolton Wanderers who were looking for a number of ex-professionals to head their recruitment drive led by former Everton F.C.Everton manager Colin Harvey.\nIn October 2010 he left Bolton to join first club Liverpool F.C.Liverpool and was given a senior role under then Reds manager Roy Hodgson.",

Unable to break into the team, because of his young age and\nthe contemporary explosion of Alessandro Del Piero, he was loaned to A.S. Lucchese-LibertasLucchese (76 games, 8 goals) and then A.C. ChievoVeronaChievo (18 games, 2 goals) before switching to Modena F.C.Modena. There he found some real form, scoring 30 times in 58 appearances. This performance saw him signed by Ternana CalcioTernana, where he played for one season before been loaned to Ravenna CalcioRavenna where he scored 13 goals. When he returned to Ternana he became a regular scorer again, with 20 goals in 34 games and became idol for the local supporters, who still remember him as the best player to ever have played for Ternana.\nHis season with Ternana saw him attract attention of various Serie A clubs, including Udinese and AC Milan. But apparently Luciano Moggi of Juventus, who had previously pressured Grabbi to change his agent and join GEA World with no success, made it impossible for Ciccio to play in Italy, so in 2001 he was signed by Blackburn Rovers F.C.Blackburn Rovers for a record fee of \u00a36.75 million in July 2001-02 in English football2001, but due to injuries and personal reasons, he failed to repeat this progress, scoring just once in fourteen league games, his goal coming in a 1\u20130 win over Everton.cite web\nurl=\ntitle=Blackburn sink Everton\npublisher=BBC\ndate=22 September 2001 accessdate=15 September 2009 He scored once more before going on loan to Messina, in the FA Cup against Barnsley.cite web\nurl=\ntitle=Blackburn dispatch Barnsley\npublisher=BBC\ndate=15 January 2002 accessdate=2 November 2009 Grabbi's move to Blackburn is widely regarded as one of the worst transfers in the history of the Premier League.\nIn the same interview, Grabbi stated that the only person who he became friends with in this time was Tugay Kerimo\u011flu.\nDespite his unsuccessful spell at Blackburn Rovers, Grabbi still has a cult following with fans of the club.\nDuring a loan spell back in Italy with F.C.

With his new team, he gained promotion to Serie B on playoffs scoring 9 goals in 25 games.\nBefore the return playoff final, Grabbi announced he was considering retiring from football, because of his physical conditions, but later he declared he was persuaded to go on by the Genoa supporters and fellow players, as well as club president Enrico Preziosi.

ArezzoArezzo, still in Serie B, after having never made a single appearance in the first half of the season for Genoa. After relegation with Arezzo, scoring no goals, Grabbi signed a contract with AC Bellinzona, a team from the Swiss Challenge League (second division).

Pointon was a left-back who is perhaps best remembered for playing for Everton F.C.Everton, Manchester City and Oldham Athletic.\nPointon began his career at lower-league Scunthorpe United and quickly established himself as a regular first-teamer and a consistent and reliable performer in defence. In the autumn of 1985, after four years at Scunthorpe, Pointon was bought by the reigning English league champions Everton for \u00a375,000, manager Howard Kendall hoping Pointon could provide squad cover for regular left-back Pat Van Den Hauwe. Ultimately Pointon ended up featuring in the majority of Everton's games during the remainder of the 1985/86 season as a result of Van den Hauwe moving to central defence to cover for the injured centre-back Derek Mountfield. Everton finished that season as runners-up to local rivals Liverpool F.C.Liverpool in both the league championship and the FA Cup, though Pointon played no part in the FA Cup final due to Mountfield's return to fitness.\nIn the following season, Pointon struggled with injury and had to compete with not only Van den Hauwe but also veteran defender Paul Power (footballer born 1953)Paul Power, signed from Manchester City, for the left-back spot at Goodison. Pointon did however play enough games that year to qualify for a Championship winners medal as Everton won their second title in three years.\nOver the next couple of years Pointon was a consistent performer in the Everton defence when called up to the first team, although Kendall's departure to Athletic Bilbao and the break-up of the Championship winning side saw a decline in the club's fortunes. During 1989/90, Pointon became Everton's first choice left-back following the sale of Van den Hauwe to Tottenham Hotspur F.C.Tottenham Hotspur.\nIn the summer of 1990, Pointon left Everton to rejoin Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City, with Kendall receiving Pointon and \u00a3300,000 in exchange for Andy Hinchcliffe. Pointon spent two years at City as a first-team regular before moving on to Joe Royle's Oldham Athletic A.F.C.Oldham Athletic, then a top-flight club. Pointon spent three years at Boundary Park, during which time the club were relegated from the FA Premier LeaguePremiership.\nOn 10 April 1994, Pointon put the Latics ahead in the 106th minute (extra time) of the FA Cup semi final at Wembley Stadium against Manchester United F.C.Manchester United, only for Mark Hughes to equalise one minute before the final whistle and force a replay. The replay at Maine Road saw the Latics lose 4\u20131. United went on to win both the Premier League title and FA Cup, while Pointon and his colleagues had the double misery of an FA Cup exit and Premier League relegation in less than a month.  During this period Neil made the tabloid papers following a brief liaison with television personality Dani Behr.\nPointon joined Scottish Premier Division outfit Heart of Midlothian F.C.Heart of Midlothian in 1995, enjoying a number of seasons up in Scotland before later playing for Walsall F.C.Walsall, Chesterfield F.C.Chesterfield and Hednesford Town. He scored for Hednesford against former club Oldham Athletic in an FA Cup tie at Keys Park, soon before being handed the reins as Manager at Hednesford. He lasted as little as 9 games in his first Managerial post before being sacked after not winning a single game. The club later got relegated, but very few fans of the Staffordshire Club actually put the blame with him.\nAfter a spell as player-manager of Retford United he joined Mossley as a player and helped Mossley to win the Worthington Challenge Trophy at Gigg Lane, Bury with a 2\u20131 win over Clitheroe in his last ever professional game.\nHe currently works for the Bolton Wanderers Academy team as a coach.",

Thompson played his final professional game for Northampton in 1997. Whilst at Cardiff in December 1993 it was his goal which gave them a 1\u20130 win over South Wales rivals Swansea, however the goal and the victory sparked off a mass pitch invasion and subsequent violence in what was to become one of the most notorious moments in Welsh football.\nAlthough he spent several seasons as an inventive and influential player at top-flight clubs, he was never selected for the England international squad, though his name was regularly mentioned prior to call-ups. His non-selection is thought to be because he never played for any of the more illustrious top-flight English clubs rather than a lack of international-class ability. This was all the more surprising considering he played six times as an England Under-21 international whilst playing at his peak during the 1981\u20131982 season, scoring on three occasions.\nAfter retiring as a player, he became a coach and in 2001 he took over as caretaker manager of Bristol Rovers F.C.Bristol Rovers following the termination of employmentsacking of Ian Holloway.

Despite this, he managed to score 6 goals in his first full season with the club, establishing himself as one of the most dangerous attacking midfielders in the Premier League, helping Ipswich to an impressive fifth place finish in the 2000-2001 season and a return for the club to UEFA Cup football. After that, however, the injuries really set in. Ipswich were relegated the following season and he also fell out with new manager Joe Royle.\nReuser left Ipswich and joined Willem II TilburgWillem II for the 2004\u20132005 season. He was less troubled by injury in the Netherlands, but he missed 2 months of the season with Achilles tendon problems. He was still the club's top scorer as the team finished 11th in the table. The following season was more difficult for Willem II. Reuser spent a lot of the season on the sidelines, and the side finished 16th in the table, which meant play-offs again for Reuser. He saved his side, with a hat-trick in their semi-final against FC Zwolle. Martijn signed for another Dutch side RKC Waalwijk for the 2006\u20132007 season. He played for NAC Breda in the 2009\u201310 season. In January 2012, Reuser was linked with a return to former club Ipswich Town.[",

He served nine years as Stuttgart's regular goalkeeper, winning the Bundesliga title in 1992 and the UEFA Cup runner-up medal in 1989 with them. Afterwards he left for Manchester City F.C.Manchester City, where he retired at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.\nHis West Germany national football teamWest Germany career lasted for just eight years due to his decision to retire from the West German team following EURO'88.

Inter manager Roberto Mancini brought Balotelli into the first team, but when Mancini left, Balotelli's disciplinary record fell away. He had a strained relationship with new manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and was suspended from Inter's first team in January 2009 after a number of disciplinary problems. In March 2010, he came under criticism by Inter fans after he appeared on the Italian TV show ''Striscia la notizia'', wearing an A.C. Milan jersey. This damaged the prospect of him having a long career at Inter, but he did make several appearances after that.\nWith doubts over his career at Inter, former coach Roberto Mancini had since moved to Manchester City and decided to give Balotelli a fresh chance at a new club. He joined Manchester City in August 2010, where his performances and off-field activities continued to be enigmatic and unpredictable. Balotelli eventually fell out of favour with Mancini after a \"training ground bust up\" between the two in January 2013. His departure from City and return to Italy with A.C.

Elkins was signed for \u00a320,000 by Wimbledon - at that time an established top-flight club - following seven years of largely unheralded and irregular service for a then third-tier Fulham side.  It was thought that new Wimbledon manager Ray Harford remembered Elkins fondly from his own time as Fulham manager in the mid-1980s.\nBrentford F.C. manager Steve Perryman revealed that he resigned as manager of Brentford in 1991 on account of his chairman's refusal to let him sign Elkins for a nominal fee. The reason given by the chairman was that the player had 'shifty eyes'.[\nHe was a sturdy and tough defender, slow to commit to a rash challenge but instead prone to holding up wingers by strong positioning. Indeed, some of the game's best wide-men, in particular Andrei Kanchelskis and Anders Limpar, found Elkins tough to negotiate, their game preferring defenders to put a foot in. Elkins finest moment was probably a last-minute equaliser, albeit heavily deflected, against Liverpool F.C. at Selhurst Park in 1994.\nIn 1996, Elkins' career took a turn for the worse as he was signed by Steve McMahon (footballer)Steve McMahon at Swindon Town F.C.Swindon Town. Signed for \u00a3100,000 by a club facing financial difficulties, the pressure was on Elkins to help inspire a promotion bid to the FA Premier LeaguePremiership. As it was, he started only 19 games for the club, his form and fitness (in particular his weight) in doubt. He soon moved into non-league football, working too as a coach at the Elms Soccer School in Middlesex.\nElkins was also a successful Sunday Morning Soccer Coach for The Royal Standard in Wallingford, a team that played in the Reading Sunday League.\nIn 2006, Gary joined BGB Southern League South & West team Didcot Town FC as Reserve Team Manager but was then promoted the season after to First Team Coach.
