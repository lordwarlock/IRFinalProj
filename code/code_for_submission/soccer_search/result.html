                    <li><span>Summary: Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that plays in the Premier League. Founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, the club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to Old Trafford in 1910. Manchester United have won 20 league titles, the most of any English club, a joint-record 11 FA Cups, four League Cups, and a record 20 FA Community Shields. The club has also won three European Cups, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 199899, the club achieved a treble of the Premier League, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, Manchester United was the first English football club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson won 28 major honours between 1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement. Louis van Gaal was appointed as the club's new manager after Ferguson's successor David Moyes was sacked after only 10 months in charge. Manchester United is the second-richest football club in the world for 201314 in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of 518 million, and the world's second most valuable sports team in 2013, valued at $3.165 billion. It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost 800 million, after which the company was taken private again. In August 2012, Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.<br>

                    <li><span>Summary: Liverpool Football Club /lvrpul/ is a Premier League football club based in Liverpool. The club have won more European trophies than any other English team with five European Cups, three UEFA Cups and three UEFA Super Cups. They have also won eighteen League titles, seven FA Cups and a record eight League Cups, although they are yet to win a Premier League title since its inception in 1992. Liverpool were founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year. They have played at Anfield since its formation. The most successful period in Liverpool's history was the 1970s and '80s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to eleven league titles and seven European trophies. The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, during which charging Liverpool fans caused a crush that resulted in a wall collapsing and the death of 39 Juventus supporters, after which English clubs were banned from European competition for five years. In the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing. Liverpool have long-standing rivalries with neighbours Everton and with Manchester United. The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".<br>
