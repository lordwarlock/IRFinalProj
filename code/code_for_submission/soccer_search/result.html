                    <li><span>Summary: Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Holloway, London that plays in English football's top tier, the Premier League. One of the most decorated clubs in English football, they have won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and a joint record 11 FA Cups. Arsenal have one of the best records in top flight matches, having accumulated the second most wins, the second most points, the ongoing record longest uninterrupted period in the top flight, and would be placed first in an aggregated league of the entire 20th century. At 14 and 49 matches, Arsenal hold both the longest winning streak and the longest unbeaten streak; the latter includes the only completely unbeaten season since Preston North End's 16 match shorter equivalent in the inaugural Football League season 115 years before. Arsenal was founded in 1886 in Woolwich and in 1893 became the first club from the south of England to join the Football League. In 1913, they moved north across the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. In the 1930s, they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the League and FA Cup Double, in the 197071 season, and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles and reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Since neighbouring Tottenham Hotspur, the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the North London derby. Arsenal have one of the highest incomes and largest fanbases in the world, including the second most lucrative stadium and the third most Twitter followers. Forbes estimates the club is the fifth most valuable association football club in the world, valued over 1.3 billion in 2014.<br>

                    <li><span>Summary: Tottenham Hotspur Football Club /ttnm/, commonly referred to as Spurs, is an English football club located in Tottenham, London, that plays in the Premier League. The club's home stadium is White Hart Lane. Its newly developed training ground is in Bulls Cross on the northern borders of the London Borough of Enfield. Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League. Tottenham was the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 196061 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 it became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition  the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1967 it won the FA Cup for a third time in the 1960s. In the 1970s Tottenham won the League Cup on two occasions and was the inaugural winner of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. In the 1980s Spurs won several trophies: the FA Cup twice, FA Community Shield and the UEFA Cup in 1984. In the 1990s the club won the FA Cup and the League Cup. When it won the League Cup once more in 2008, it meant that it had won a major trophy in each of the last six decades  an achievement only matched by Manchester United. The club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere (lit: "To Dare Is to Do"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby neighbours Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.<br>

                    <li><span>Summary: Swindon Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Swindon, Wiltshire. The club participates in League One, the third tier in the English football league system, in which it has spent 32 of its 87 League seasons (to 2014), with a further 30 in the former Division 3 South. The club's home ground, where it has played for 120 years since 1896, is the County Ground, which has a capacity of 15,728. The club was founded in 1879, became professional in 1894 and entered the Football League in 1920. It has enjoyed periods of success, most notably during 196870, winning the 1969 League Cup by defeating Arsenal at Wembley Stadium and securing promotion to the Second Division. League Cup success earned the club its first invitations to European competitions, but they were not eligible to participate because they played in the then Third Division. So as compensation they were entered into the 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup and the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup, with Swindon winning both. These wins were led by the club's talisman winger Don Rogers. The South Stand was named after him from the 200708 season. The club's two best wins were 10 goals to 2 over Norwich City on 5 September 1908 and 10 goals to 1 over Farnham United Breweries F.C. in the season of 192526 while the worst loss was 10 goal to 1 down against Manchester City in 1930. Swindon Town won promotion to the Premier League during the 199293 season, the only time the club has played in the top level of English football. Swindon was the second team to win promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs, beating Leicester City. This proved to be Swindon's only season in the top flight to date, in which they conceded 100 goals. However, based on all results during their time in the Premier League and Football League up to 201011, Swindon are ranked as the all-time 47th most successful English football club domestically.<br>

                    <li><span>Summary: West Ham United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Upton Park, east London, England currently playing in the Premier League, England's top tier of football. The club was founded in 1895 as Thames Ironworks and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. In 1904 the club relocated to their current Boleyn Ground stadium. They initially competed in the Southern League and Western League before eventually joining the full Football League in 1919 and subsequently enjoyed promotion to the top flight for the 1923 season. 1923 also saw the club feature in the first FA Cup Final to be held at Wembley against Bolton Wanderers. In 1940 the team won the inaugural Football League War Cup. The club has won the FA Cup three times: in 1964, 1975 and 1980 as well as being runners-up twice, in 1923 and 2006. In 1965, they won the European Cup Winners Cup, and in 1999 they won the Intertoto Cup. They are one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 56 of 88 league seasons in Division 1, or the Premier League, to 2014. However, unlike the other seven (Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur), the club has never won the league title. The club's best final league position is third place in the 198586 First Division. Three West Ham players played significant roles in England's victory in the 1966 World Cup final; captain Bobby Moore, and both goalscorers, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.<br>

                    <li><span>Summary: Blackburn Rovers Football Club /blkbrn rovrz/ is an English professional association football club based in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire. The team competes in the Football League Championship from the 201213 season. They were relegated from the Premier League, the top tier of English football, at the end of the 201112 season. The club are currently managed by Gary Bowyer after previous manager Michael Appleton was dismissed on 19 March 2013. Appleton was the third manager to have lost his job in 6 months after Steve Kean and Henning Berg. The club was established in 1875, becoming a founding member of The Football League in 1888. It is one of only three clubs to have been both a founder member of the Football League and the Premier League (the others being Aston Villa and Everton). In 1890 Rovers moved to its permanent home at Ewood Park. Prior to the formation of the Premier League in 1992, most of the club's successes were before 1930, when it had gained league and FA Cup trophies on several occasions. Relegation in 196566 was followed by 26 successive seasons of football outside the top flight. In 1992, Blackburn gained promotion to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local steel baron Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Blackburn became Premier League champions, having spent millions of pounds on players like Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton. However, the title-winning team was quickly split up and, in the 199899 season, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, in the 200001 season, just after Walker's death. During this time it has qualified for the UEFA Cup four times: once as League Cup winners, twice as the Premier League's sixth-placed team and once via the Intertoto Cup. The 201112 season marked the club's 72nd, non-consecutive, year in the top flight. Blackburn are currently one of only five clubs to have won the Premier League, along with Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City. The club's motto is "Arte et Labore", which the club translates as "By Skill and Hard Work" in Latin.<br>
